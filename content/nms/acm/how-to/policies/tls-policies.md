## Overview

{{< include "acm/how-to/policies-intro.md" >}}

The types of communication you can apply TLS policies to includes:

- ingress traffic to an API or Dev Portal proxy;
- communications between an API proxy and a backend API service; and
- communications between the API Connectivity Manager management plane and the Dev Portal data plane.

---

### Before You Begin

Complete the following prerequisites before proceeding with this guide:

- API Connectivity Manager is installed, licensed, and running.
- You have one or more Environments with [API Gateway]({{< relref "/nms/acm/getting-started/add-api-gateway" >}}) or [Dev Portal]({{< relref "/nms/acm/getting-started/add-devportal" >}}) clusters.

## Secure Ingress Traffic

Take the steps in this section to secure the traffic coming into your API Proxies.

### Add TLS Listener

{{<tabs name="add_tls_listener">}}
    {{%tab name="UI"%}}

1. In the API Connectivity Manager user interface, go to **Workspaces > Environments > \<your environment\>**, where "your environment" is the Environment that contains the Developer Portal.
1. Select **Edit Advanced Config** from the **Actions** menu for the desired Developer Portal.
1. On the **Listeners** tab, select **Add Listener**.
1. Provide the desired **Protocol** and **Port** (for example, `443`) and select the **TLS** checkbox.

    {{%/tab%}}
    {{%tab name="API"%}}

```json
"listeners": [
    {
        "transportProtocol": "HTTP",
        "port": 443,
        "tlsEnabled": true,
        "ipv6": false
    }
```

    {{%/tab%}}
{{</tabs>}}

### Add TLS Inbound Policy {#add-tls-inbound}

{{<tabs name="tls-inbound">}}
{{%tab name="UI"%}}

1. Select the **Global Policies** tab.
1. Select **Add Policy** from the **Actions** menu for the **TLS Inbound** policy.
1. On the **TLS Inbound** policy page, provide the requested information.

    - **Protocols:** The TLS and SSL protocols that will be used for securing communication.
    - **Cipher:** The set of algorithms or a set of instructions/steps that helps to establish the secure connection.
    - **Session Timeout:** Specifies the time during which a client may reuse the session parameters.
    - **Session Cache:** Sets whether a session can be re-used.  When off, a full negotiation is performed for every connection.
    - **Session Type:** Determines the cache type for re-using sessions.
    - **Session Size:** Sets the shared cache size.

1. Upload a Server Certificate, Certificate Key, and CA Certificate.

    - Select the upload icon in the **Server Certificate** field and browse for the desired certificate on your file system.
    - Select the upload icon in the **Certificate Key** field and browse for the desired key file on your file system.
    - Select the upload icon in the **CA Certificates** field and browse for the desired Root CA certificate on your file system.

1. (Optional) Select the **Verify Client Certificate** toggle and complete the configurations as appropriate.
1. Select **Add** to save and add the policy.
1. Select **Save and Submit**.

{{%tab name="API"%}}

```json
"policies": {
    "tls-inbound": [
        {
            "data": {
                "serverCerts": [
                    {
                        "key": {{tlsKey}},
                        "cert": {{tlsCert}}
                    }
                ],
                "trustedRootCACerts":{{caCert}}
            }
        }
    ]
}
```

{{%/tab%}}
{{</tabs>}}

### Verify HTTPS Connection

Once the Environment configuration has been submitted and applied, the **Job Status** for the Environment will change to **Success**.
You can then navigate to the Dev Portal user interface to verify that your connection is secured using HTTPS.

## Secure Communications between API Proxy and Backend Service

Take the steps in this section to secure the communications between your Proxies and the associated API backend services. When mTLS is enabled, the API Gateway identifies itself to the backend service using an SSL client certificate.

### Add TLS Backend Policy {#add-tls-backend}

{{<tabs name="tls-backend">}}
{{%tab name="UI"%}}

1. In the API Connectivity Manager user interface, go to **Workspaces > Environments > \<your environment\>**, where "your environment" is the Environment that contains the API Gateway to be updated.
1. Select **Edit Advanced Config** from the **Actions** menu for the desired API Gateway.
1. Select the **Global Policies** tab, then select **Add Policy** from the **Actions** menu for the **TLS Backend** policy.
1. On the **TLS Backend** policy page, provide the requested information.

    - **Protocols:** The TLS and SSL protocols that will be used for securing communication to the proxied server.
    - **Cipher:** The set of algorithms or a set of instructions/steps that helps to establish the secure connection to the proxied server.
    - **Verify Certificate Chain Depth:** Sets the verification depth in the client certificates chain.

1. Upload a Client Certificate, Certificate Key, and CA Certificate.

    - Select the upload icon in the **Client Certificate** field and browse for the desired certificate on your file system.
    - Select the upload icon in the **Certificate Key** field and browse for the desired key file on your file system.
    - (Optional) Provide the Client ID and select the upload icon to upload a Trusted Root CA, then browse for the desired Root CA certificate on your file system.

1. Select **Add** to save and add the policy.
1. Select **Save and Submit**.

{{%/tab%}}
{{%tab name="API"%}}

```json
"policies": {
    "tls-backend": [
        { "action": {
            "cipher": "HIGH:!aNULL:!MD5",
            "protocols": [
                "TLSv1.2"
            ]
        },
            "data": {
                "trustedRootCACerts":"{{caCert}}",
                "clientCerts": [
                    {
                        "cert": "{{clientCert}}",
                        "key": "{{clientKey}}"

                    }
                ]
            }
        }
    ]
}
```
