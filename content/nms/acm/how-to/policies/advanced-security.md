## About Advanced Security Policy

Use the *Advanced Security* policy to add a pre-defined F5 NGINX App Protect to your deployment. Doing so will apply the rules specified in the policy to your APIs.
This will allow enforcement of rules to *Block* or *Monitor* security events triggering those violations set out in the policy.

## Before You Begin

To complete the steps in this guide, you need the following:

- API Connectivity Manager is installed, licensed, and running.
- You have one or more [Environments with an API Gateway]({{< relref "/nms/acm/getting-started/add-api-gateway" >}}).
- You have [published one or more API Gateways]({{< relref "/nms/acm/getting-started/publish-api-proxy" >}}).
- You have [installed and set up NGINX App Protect]({{< relref "/nap-waf/v4/admin-guide/install-nms" >}}).

---

## Policy Settings

The applied policy is configurable, and all events created by rule violations will go to the `Security Monitoring` dashboard in NGINX Management Suite.

To create a new policy or modify an existing policy, you can navigate to the *App Protect* area of the NGINX Management Suite.

*NGINX App Protect* policies can also contain a reference to an Open API Specification which will enable payload schema validation on the dataplane instance.

{{< note >}}

For information on how to configure an *App Protect* policy, please visit - [Configure NGINX App Protect WAF](https://docs.nginx.com/nginx-app-protect/configuration-guide/configuration/#policy-configuration-overview)

To create an NGINX App Protect WAF policy to use in your Advanced Security policy, please see the [Create a Policy]({{< relref "/nim/nginx-app-protect/manage-waf-security-policies#create-security-policy" >}}) documentation.

## Applying the Policy

*NGINX App Protect* policies can be applied to both *Environments* and *Proxies*, allowing for granular control.

Should you wish to configure a global monitoring policy (non-blocking), but require blocking on only a subset of your API endpoints, you can apply a monitoring policy to your environment and a blocking policy on the proxy you have deployed to that environment.

This means that only the specific *Proxy* that you have applied the policy to will be enforced in blocking mode and the other endpoints in that environment are unaffected, inherting the monitoring policy from their parent *Environment*.

*Proxies* in an *Environment* can also each have their own different policies applied should that be required.

There are two methods available to enable adding an *Advanced Security* policy to your Deployment:

{{%tab name="API"%}}

{{<see-also>}}{{< include "acm/how-to/access-acm-api.md" >}}{{</see-also>}}

To create an *Advanced Security* policy using the REST API, send an HTTP `POST` or `PUT` request to the *Environments* endpoint.
