## Upgrade API Connectivity Manager {#upgrade-acm}

{{<note>}}When you confirm the upgrade, the upgrade process will automatically upgrade dependent packages as needed, including Instance Manager. If you prefer to [back up NGINX Management Suite]({{< relref "/nim/admin-guide/maintenance/backup-and-recovery.md" >}}) before upgrading, you can cancel the upgrade when prompted.{{</note>}}
