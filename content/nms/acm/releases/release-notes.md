  When creating an API proxy using an OAS file, the following values will not be editable in the web interface if they are provided via the OAS spec file:

  ```json
  servers:
   url: http://{server}.hostname.com/api/{version}
    variables:
      server:
        default: customers
      version:
        default: v1
      basePathVersionAppendRule:
        default : none
      stripBasePathVersion:
        default : false
  ```

- {{% icon-feature %}} **OpenAPI specification support for OAuth2 JWT assertion policy**<a name="1-9-0-whats-new-OpenAPI-specification-support-for-OAuth2-JWT-assertion-policy"></a>

  You can now specify an OAuth2 JWT assertion policy to apply to the API Proxy being created using an OpenAPI specification file.

- {{% icon-feature %}} **Backend server configuration from OpenAPI specification file**<a name="1-9-0-whats-new-Backend-server-configuration-from-OpenAPI-specification-file"></a>

  You can provide the backend server configuration for upstream servers in an OpenAPI specification file using extensions specific to API Connectivity Manager. See the [Publish an API Proxy]({{< relref "/nms/acm/getting-started/publish-api-proxy.md#publish-api-proxy-with-spec" >}}) documentation.

  The `matchRule` field is now available in the `route` items in `proxyConfig.ingress`. This field is optional and allows you to define a path matching rule for advanced routes.

  The OpenAPI Specification now supports the `x-acm-match-rule` extension for defining match rules for paths within routes. If you don't specify a value for this extension, it will default to `EXACT`. The only allowed values for `matchRule` are the strings `EXACT` and `PREFIX`.


### Changes in Default Behavior{#1-8-0-changes-in-behavior}
This release has the following changes in default behavior:

- {{% icon-feature %}} **Proxy labels removed**<a name="1-8-0-changes-in-behavior-Proxy-labels-removed"></a>

  Labels on proxies were added with future use cases in mind although without a current need. The proxy labels have been removed to avoid confusion as to their purpose.


### Resolved Issues{#1-8-0-resolved-issues}
This release fixes the following issues. Select an issue's ID link to view its details.

- {{% icon-resolved %}} Environments with WAF enabled may transition to a Failed status when a Developer Portal cluster is added.

### What's New{#1-7-0-whats-new}
This release includes the following updates:

- {{% icon-feature %}} **Advanced Security Policy**<a name="1-7-0-whats-new-Advanced-Security-Policy"></a>

  The new [Advanced Security policy]({{< relref "/nms/acm/how-to/policies/advanced-security.md" >}}) can be used to add a pre-defined NGINX App Protect configuration to your deployment.  Doing so will apply the rules specified in the policy to your APIs.

- {{% icon-feature %}} **Option added to allow API proxy to ignore invalid headers**<a name="1-7-0-whats-new-Option-added-to-allow-API-proxy-to-ignore-invalid-headers"></a>

  The [Request Header Specification policy]({{< relref "/nms/acm/how-to/policies/request-header-specification.md" >}}) allows headers with (.) and (\_) characters to be proxied to backend services.

  By default, NGINX server will drop all headers that contain (.) and (\_) characters in the header name. Though not common, it is a legal character in headers. This feature will allow users to instruct NGINX to allow such headers to be proxied.

- {{% icon-feature %}} **Regex support added to access control routing claims**<a name="1-7-0-whats-new-Regex-support-added-to-access-control-routing-claims"></a>

  Access control routing claims can be arrays. For example, roles and groups are typically represented as an array. You can now use a regular expression to match against claims embedded in arrays.

- {{% icon-feature %}} **Ingress routing rules now allow using regular expressions**<a name="1-7-0-whats-new-Ingress-routing-rules-now-allow-using-regular-expressions"></a>

  Regular expressions are now supported in routing rules. This will enable routing of requests that match against strings like `?wsdl`.

  The [gRPC proxy can be enabled with a Health Check policy]({{< relref "/nms/acm/how-to/policies/grpc-policies.md#health-check" >}}), allowing it to check the health status of backend gRPC services and route requests accordingly.

- {{% icon-feature %}} **Improved certificate handling**<a name="1-5-0-whats-new-Improved-certificate-handling"></a>

  API Connectivity Manager will not generate new certificates if any have already been specified in the TLS policy; instead, ACM will reference the existing certificates. In this way, wildcard certificates may be employed.


### Security Updates{#1-5-0-security-updates}

{{< important >}}
For the protection of our customers, NGINX doesn’t disclose security issues until an investigation has occurred and a fix is available.
{{< /important >}}

This release includes the following security updates:

- {{% icon-resolved %}} **Instance Manager vulnerability CVE-2023-1550**<a name="1-5-0-security-updates-Instance-Manager-vulnerability-CVE-2023-1550"></a>

  NGINX Agent inserts sensitive information into a log file ([CVE-2023-1550](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-1550)). An authenticated attacker with local access to read NGINX Agent log files may gain access to private keys. This issue is exposed only when the non-default trace-level logging is enabled.

  NGINX Agent is included with NGINX Instance Manager, and used in conjunction with API Connectivity Manager and the Security Monitoring module.

  This issue has been classified as [CWE-532: Insertion of Sensitive Information into Log File](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/532.html).

  - Mitigation:

    - Avoid configuring trace-level logging in the NGINX Agent configuration file. For more information, refer to the [Configuring the NGINX Agent]({{< relref "/nms/nginx-agent/install-nginx-agent.md#configuring-the-nginx-agent ">}}) section of NGINX Management Suite documentation. If trace-level logging is required, ensure only trusted users have access to the log files.

  - Fixed in:

    - NGINX Agent 2.23.3
    - Instance Manager 2.9.0

  For more information, refer to the MyF5 article [K000133135](https://my.f5.com/manage/s/article/K000133135).

### What's New{#1-3-0-whats-new}
This release includes the following updates:

- {{% icon-feature %}} **Configure access-controlled routing**<a name="1-3-0-whats-new-Configure-access-controlled-routing"></a>

  API lifecycle management requires routing API traffic with fine-level control, which is something that token-based authentication schemes that leverage JWT claims do well. Permissions can be encoded as custom claims in the token. Then, once the API proxy validates the token (JWT), it can access all the fields in the token as variables. Decisions can be made based on matching the claims.

  - Applying Fine-Grained Access Control

      API Owners can apply fine-grained access control and restrict access to their APIs based on specific claims in the token. The policy can be configured to enforce fine-grained control for specific routes or be fine-tuned to support particular methods per route.

  - Header-Based Routing

      Routing decisions can be made based on headers in the incoming requests. API owners can configure rules and conditions that must be matched before routing requests.

  See [Configure Access Control Routing]({{< relref "/nms/acm/how-to/policies/access-control-routing.md" >}}) to learn how to restrict access to your application servers based on JWT claims or header values.

- {{% icon-feature %}} **Use the web interface to publish and manage gRPC services**<a name="1-3-0-whats-new-Use-the-web-interface-to-publish-and-manage-gRPC-services"></a>

  With API Connectivity Manager 1.2, we introduced support for [publishing and managing gRPC services]({{< relref "/nms/acm/how-to/policies/grpc-policies.md" >}}). Now, in this release, we extend that capability to the web interface.

  You can secure gRPC services with the following policies:

  - gRPC environment policies

    - Error Response Format
    - Log Format
    - Proxy Response Headers
    - Request Body Size Limit
    - Request Correlation ID
    - TLS Backend
    - TLS Inbound

  - gRPC proxy policies:

    - ACL IP Restriction
    - APIKey Authentication
    - Basic Authentication
    - GRPC Backend Config
    - JSON Web Token Assertion
    - OAuth2 Introspection
    - Proxy Request Headers
    - Rate Limit

- {{% icon-feature %}} **Secure communication between API Connectivity Manager and Developer Portal with mTLS**<a name="1-3-0-whats-new-Secure-communication-between-API-Connectivity-Manager-and-Developer-Portal-with-mTLS"></a>

  API Connectivity Manager communicates with the Developer Portal host to publish API docs and create API credentials. Now, PlatformOps can secure this communication channel by enabling mTLS between the hosts.

  Previously, mTLS required a TLS backend policy on the internal portal proxy cluster. API Connectivity Manager 1.3 removes that restriction. The TLS inbound policy on the internal portal allows providing a client certificate for API Connectivity Manager when mTLS is enabled. API Connectivity Manager presents this client certificate when connecting to the Developer Portal, identifying itself as a trusted client.

- {{% icon-feature %}} **Other Enhancements**<a name="1-3-0-whats-new-Other-Enhancements"></a>

  - **Improved policy layout**

    The Policy user interface has been improved with highlights for the different policy sections.

  - **NGINX Management Suite config changes are preserved during upgrade**

      Upgrades no longer overwrite customized configurations unless instructed to by the user.

  - **Support for chained certificates**

    Infrastructure administrators can now upload public certificates in PEM format, along with an optional list of intermediate certificates for validating the public certificate.

  - **Support for SNI requirements from hosted services**

    API owners can now use the OAuth2 policy with hosted Identity Provider services that enforce Server Name Indication (SNI).

### What's New{#1-2-0-whats-new}
This release includes the following updates:

- {{% icon-feature %}} **Restrict access to APIs based on IP address**<a name="1-2-0-whats-new-Restrict-access-to-APIs-based-on-IP-address"></a>

  Using the [ACL-IP policy]({{< relref "/nms/acm/how-to/policies/api-access-control-lists.md" >}}), API owners can now restrict access to APIs based on IP addresses. APIs can be protected by quickly blocking rogue requests from certain IPs or allowing access to only known IPs.

- {{% icon-feature %}} **Secure API access with OAuth2 tokens**<a name="1-2-0-whats-new-Secure-API-access-with-OAuth2-tokens"></a>

  API Owners can [restrict access to their APIs with OAuth2 tokens]({{< relref "/nms/acm/how-to/policies/introspection.md" >}}) by swapping an opaque token for claims or a JWT token to be proxied to the backend service. The policy can be configured to grant access to APIs after having the tokens introspected. In addition, the claims in the token can be extracted and forwarded to the backend service.

  {{<tip>}}Learn how to [set up an OAuth2 Introspection policy with Keycloak]({{< relref "/nms/acm/tutorials/introspection-keycloak.md" >}}) as the authorization server.{{</tip>}}

- {{% icon-feature %}} **Enhanced API documentation on developer portal**<a name="1-2-0-whats-new-Enhanced-API-documentation-on-developer-portal"></a>

  The API documentation published to the Developer Portal now displays detailed security schema information for each API.

- {{% icon-feature %}} **Support for HTTP/2**<a name="1-2-0-whats-new-Support-for-HTTP/2"></a>

  To improve the performance and efficiency of client-server interactions, HTTP/2 can be enabled on the [API proxies]({{< relref "/nms/acm/getting-started/publish-api-proxy.md#set-up-api-proxy" >}}). With HTTP/2 enabled, API Proxies will continue to maintain backward compatibility with older browsers.

- {{% icon-feature %}} **Improved visualizations for resource credentials**<a name="1-2-0-whats-new-Improved-visualizations-for-resource-credentials"></a>

  API owners can now view the origin of resource credentials. The source field indicates where the credentials were created. For security reasons, the credentials created on the Developer Portal will be masked, but the API owners can view the origin of the resource credentials.

- {{% icon-feature %}} **Express API payload size with unit of measure**<a name="1-2-0-whats-new-Express-API-payload-size-with-unit-of-measure"></a>

  The maximum allowed size for the client request body can now be configured in bytes, kilobytes(K) or megabytes(M).

  The `maxRequestBodySizeLimit` attribute of the policy is deprecated and will be removed in API Connectivity Manager 1.3.0. `Size` is the new attribute that supports bytes, megabytes(M), and kilobytes(K). The default setting is 1M.

- {{% icon-feature %}} **Database backup included in support packages**<a name="1-2-0-whats-new-Database-backup-included-in-support-packages"></a>

  The [Developer Portal support package]({{< relref "/nms/support/support-package.md" >}}) now includes the option to back up the PostgreSQL database.

- {{% icon-feature %}} **Publish and manage gRPC services - preview release**<a name="1-2-0-whats-new-Publish-and-manage-gRPC-services---preview-release"></a>

  {{<important>}}This is a **preview** feature for you to try out. You shouldn't use preview features for production purposes.{{</important>}}

  To handle gRPC traffic, you can now [publish and manage gRPC proxies]({{< relref "/nms/acm/how-to/services/publish-grpc-proxy.md" >}}).

  Publish gRPC proxies and route gRPC traffic to support the following use cases:

  - Simple RPC (single request‑response)
  - Response‑streaming RPC
  - Request‑streaming RPC
  - Bidirectional‑streaming RPC
  - Route to all services in a gRPC service package
  - Route to a single gRPC service
  - Route to individual gRPC methods
  - Route to multiple gRPC services
  - Respond to errors with custom gRPC error response format policy

- {{% icon-feature %}} **Out-of-the-box protection for Developer Portals**<a name="1-2-0-whats-new-Out-of-the-box-protection-for-Developer-Portals"></a>

  Developer Portals are now deployed with out-of-the-box protection against rapid requests/overuse and server fingerprinting:

  1. Protection against server fingerprinting

    The proxy response header policy is now applied by default to a Developer Portal. The default policy disables server tokens from being returned in the proxy response.

  2. Protection against rapid requests and over-use

    To protect the portal application, the default rate limit policy limits the number of requests a client can make in a time period. Platform admins can customize the policy to meet their SLAs.

- {{% icon-feature %}} **Support for multi-host deployment pattern for Developer Portals**<a name="1-2-0-whats-new-Support-for-multi-host-deployment-pattern-for-Developer-Portals"></a>

  Developer Portals can support multiple deployment patterns. The portal backend API service can be scaled to multiple hosts and can be load-balanced using host IP addresses or internal DNS.

  To support the deployment patterns, `configs -> proxyConfig -> backends ` object has been introduced in the Portal Proxy runtime. The existing `backend` object in the `proxyCluster` object of the Portal Proxy runtime is being deprecated and will not be available in the next major release version.

### What's New{#1-1-0-whats-new}
This release includes the following updates:

- {{% icon-feature %}} **Advanced Cluster Management**<a name="1-1-0-whats-new-Advanced-Cluster-Management"></a>

  Including more than one proxy cluster with the same hostname in an environment replicates configuration across all clusters and assists with blue-green deployments. With advanced cluster management, you can use a load balancer in front of the clusters to slowly move to the newer version of the API gateway. For example, one cluster may belong to NGINX Plus version R26 and another to R27. See the [Technical Specifications]({{< relref "/nim/fundamentals/tech-specs.md#data-plane-dev-portal" >}}).

- {{% icon-feature %}} **Advanced Routing feature is available now**<a name="1-1-0-whats-new-Advanced-Routing-feature-is-available-now"></a>

  Advanced routing feature is available now. You can use it to publish an API Proxy and route specific URIs/endpoints precisely to a backend service. Advanced routing with OAS Specification allows you to import a specification file, parse all the URIs/endpoints in the file and publish API proxy by routing each URI/endpoint precisely to a backend service. To use the advanced routing feature without an OAS specification file, add the URI/endpoints while publishing the API proxy. See the [Advanced Configurations]({{< relref "/nms/acm/how-to/services/publish-api.md#advanced-configurations" >}}) section.

- {{% icon-feature %}} **SQLite is supported for Developer Portal**<a name="1-1-0-whats-new-SQLite-is-supported-for-Developer-Portal"></a>
