## Introduction

You can restrict access to your website or some parts of it by implementing a username/password authentication. Usernames and passwords are taken from a file created and populated by a password file creation tool, for example, <span style="white-space: nowrap;">`apache2-utils`</span>.

HTTP Basic authentication can also be combined with other access restriction methods, for example restricting access by [IP address]({{< relref "denylisting-ip-addresses.md" >}}) or [geographical location]({{< relref "controlling-access-by-geoip.md" >}}).

<span id="prereq"></span>
## Prerequisites

- F5 NGINX Plus or NGINX Open Source
- Password file creation utility such as <span style="white-space: nowrap;">`apache2-utils`</span> (Debian, Ubuntu) or <span style="white-space: nowrap;">`httpd-tools`</span> (RHEL/CentOS/Oracle Linux).

<span id="pass"></span>
## Creating a Password File

To create username-password pairs, use a password file creation utility, for example, <span style="white-space: nowrap;">`apache2-utils`</span> or <span style="white-space: nowrap;">`httpd-tools`</span>

1. Verify that <span style="white-space: nowrap;">`apache2-utils`</span> (Debian, Ubuntu) or <span style="white-space: nowrap;">`httpd-tools`</span> (RHEL/CentOS/Oracle Linux) is installed.
2. Create a password file and a first user. Run the `htpasswd` utility with the <span style="white-space: nowrap;">`-c`</span> flag (to create a new file), the file pathname as the first argument, and the username as the second argument:

    ```shell
    sudo htpasswd -c /etc/apache2/.htpasswd user1
    ```

    Press Enter and type the password for **user1** at the prompts.

3. Create additional user-password pairs. Omit the <span style="white-space: nowrap;">`-c`</span> flag because the file already exists:

    ```shell
    sudo htpasswd /etc/apache2/.htpasswd user2
    ```

4. You can confirm that the file contains paired usernames and hashed passwords:

    ```shell
    $ cat /etc/apache2/.htpasswd
    user1:$apr1$/woC1jnP$KAh0SsVn5qeSMjTtn0E9Q0
    user2:$apr1$QdR8fNLT$vbCEEzDj7LyqCMyNpSoBh/
    user3:$apr1$Mr5A0e.U$0j39Hp5FfxRkneklXaMrr/
    ```

## Configuring NGINX and NGINX Plus for HTTP Basic Authentication

1. Inside a location that you are going to protect, specify the [auth_basic](https://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_auth_basic_module.html#auth_basic) directive and give a name to the password-protected area. The name of the area will be shown in the username/password dialog window when asking for credentials:

    ```nginx
    location /api {
        auth_basic "Administrator’s Area";
        #...
    }
    ```

2. Specify the [auth_basic_user_file](https://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_auth_basic_module.html#auth_basic_user_file) directive with a path to the _.htpasswd_ file that contain user/password pairs:

    ```nginx
    location /api {
        auth_basic           "Administrator’s Area";
        auth_basic_user_file /etc/apache2/.htpasswd;
    }
    ```

Alternatively, you you can limit access to the whole website with basic authentication but still make some website areas public. In this case, specify the `off` parameter of the [auth_basic](https://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_auth_basic_module.html#auth_basic) directive that cancels inheritance from upper configuration levels:

```nginx
server {
    ...
    auth_basic           "Administrator’s Area";
    auth_basic_user_file conf/htpasswd;

    location /public/ {
        auth_basic off;
    }
}
```

## Combining Basic Authentication with Access Restriction by IP Address

HTTP basic authentication can be effectively combined with access restriction by IP address. You can implement at least two scenarios:

- a user must be both authenticated and have a valid IP address
- a user must be either authenticated, or have a valid IP address

1. Allow or deny access from particular IP addresses with the [allow](https://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_access_module.html#allow) and [deny](https://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_access_module.html#deny) directives:

    ```nginx
    location /api {
        #...
        deny  192.168.1.2;
        allow 192.168.1.1/24;
        allow 127.0.0.1;
        deny  all;
    }
    ```

    Access will be granted only for the `192.168.1.1/24` network excluding the `192.168.1.2` address. Note that the `allow` and `deny` directives will be applied in the order they are defined.

2. Combine restriction by IP and HTTP authentication with the [satisfy](https://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_core_module.html#satisfy) directive.
    If you set the directive to to `all`, access is granted if a client satisfies both conditions. If you set the directive to `any`, access is granted if if a client satisfies at least one condition:

    ```nginx
    location /api {
        #...
        satisfy all;

        deny  192.168.1.2;
        allow 192.168.1.1/24;
        allow 127.0.0.1;
        deny  all;

        auth_basic           "Administrator’s Area";
        auth_basic_user_file conf/htpasswd;
    }
    ```

## Complete Example

The example shows how to protect your status area with simple authentication combined with access restriction by IP address:

```nginx
http {
    server {
        listen 192.168.1.23:8080;
        root   /usr/share/nginx/html;

        location /api {
            api;
            satisfy all;

            deny  192.168.1.2;
            allow 192.168.1.1/24;
            allow 127.0.0.1;
            deny  all;

            auth_basic           "Administrator’s Area";
            auth_basic_user_file /etc/apache2/.htpasswd;
        }
    }
}
```

When you access your status page, you are prompted to log in:

[![auth_required](https://cdn.wp.nginx.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/auth_required.png)](https://cdn.wp.nginx.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/auth_required.png)

If the provided name and password do not match the password file, you get the `401 (Authorization Required)` error.
