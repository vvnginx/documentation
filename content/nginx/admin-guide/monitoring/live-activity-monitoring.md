This article describes how to configure and use runtime monitoring services in NGINX Plus: the interactive Dashboard and NGINX Plus REST API.

<span id="overview"></span>
## About Live Activity Monitoring

NGINX Plus provides various monitoring tools for your server infrastructure:

- the interactive Dashboard page available since NGINX Plus <a href="../../../releases/#r9">Release 9</a> - a real-time live activity monitoring interface that shows key load and performance metrics of your server infrastructure.

- NGINX REST API available since NGINX Plus  <a href="../../../releases/#r14">Release 14</a> - an interface that can obtain extended status information, reset statistics, manage upstream servers on-the-fly, and manage key-value store. With the API you can connect NGINX Plus status information with third-party tools that support the JSON interface, for example, NewRelic or your own dashboard.

    > **Note**: Prior to NGINX Plus <a href="../../../releases/#r14">R14</a>, gathering statistics and management of upstream servers in the Dashboard was performed with the [status](https://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_status_module.html#status) and [upstream_conf](https://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_upstream_conf_module.html) modules. Now the extended [status](https://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_status_module.html#status) and [upstream_conf](https://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_upstream_conf_module.html) modules are superseded by the [api](https://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_api_module.html) module. Starting from R16, the [status](https://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_status_module.html#status) and [upstream_conf](https://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_upstream_conf_module.html) modules will be removed and completely superseded with the [api](https://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_api_module.html) module.

## Prerequisites

- NGINX Plus <a href="../../../releases/#r14">R14</a> and later for NGINX Plus REST API and the Dashboard
- Data for statistics (see [Gathering Data to Appear in Statistics](#status_data))

<span id="status_data"></span>
## Gathering Data to Appear in Statistics

In order to collect data from virtual servers, upstream server groups, or cache zones, you will need to *enable shared memory zones* for the objects you want to collect data for. A shared memory zone stores configuration and runtime state information referenced by NGINX worker processes.

- To make [HTTP]({{< relref "../load-balancer/http-load-balancer.md" >}}) and [TCP]({{< relref "../load-balancer/tcp-udp-load-balancer.md" >}}) server to appear in statistics, specify the [`status_zone`](https://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_api_module.html#status_zone) directive. The same zone name can be specified more than once for many [`server`](https://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_core_module.html#server) blocks. Since <a href="../../../releases/#r19">R19</a>, the [status_zone](https://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_api_module.html#status_zone) directive can also be specified for [`location`](https://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_core_module.html#location) blocks - in this case, the statistics will be aggregated separately for servers and locations in the Dashboard:

    ```nginx
    server {
        # ...
        status_zone status_page;
        location / {
            proxy_pass http://backend;
            status_zone location_zone;
        }
    }
    ```

- To make an upstream server group to appear in statistics, specify the [`zone`](https://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_upstream_module.html#zone) directive per each [`upstream`](https://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_upstream_module.html#upstream) block:

    ```nginx
    upstream backend {
        zone   backend 64k;
        server backend1.example.com;
        server backend2.example.com;
    }
    ```

- To make cache appear in statistics, make sure that caching is enabled in your configuration. A shared memory zone for caching is specified in the [`proxy_cache_path`](https://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_proxy_module.html#proxy_cache_path), [`fastcgi_cache_path`](https://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_fastcgi_module.html#fastcgi_cache_path), [`scgi_cache_path`](https://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_scgi_module.html#scgi_cache_path), or [`uwsgi_cache_path`](https://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_uwsgi_module.html#uwsgi_cache_path">uwsgi_cache_path) directive in the `keys_zone` parameter. See [NGINX Content Caching]({{< relref "../content-cache/content-caching.md" >}}) for more information:

    ```nginx
    http {
        # ...
        proxy_cache_path /data/nginx/cache keys_zone=one:10m;
    }
    ```

- To make health checks appear in statistics, make sure that health checks are enabled with the [`health_check`](https://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_upstream_hc_module.html) directive and the server group resides in the [shared memory](https://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_api_module.html#status_zone). See [HTTP Health Checks]({{< relref "../load-balancer/http-health-check.md" >}}) and [TCP Health Checks]({{< relref "/nginx/admin-guide/load-balancer/tcp-health-check.md" >}}) for more information.

    ```nginx
    server {
        # ...
        status_zone status_page;
        location / {
            proxy_pass http://backend;
            health_check;
        }
    }
    ```

- To make cluster information appear in the Dashboard, make sure that F5 NGINX Plus instances are organized in the cluster and zone synchronization is enabled on each instance. See [Runtime State Sharing in a Cluster](https://docs.nginx.com/nginx/admin-guide/high-availability/zone_sync/) for details.

- To make resolver statistics appear in the Dashboard, specify the [`status_zone`](https://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_core_module.html#resolver_status_zone) parameter of the [`resolver`](https://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_core_module.html#resolver) directive:

    ```nginx
    resolver 192.168.33.70 status_zone=resolver-zone1;

    server {
        # ...
        }
    ```

- When finished, save and exit configuration file.
- Test the configuration and reload NGINX Plus:

    ```shell
    sudo nginx -t && sudo nginx -s reload
    ```

<span id="json_configure"></span>
## Configuring the API

To enable the API:

- In the [`http`](https://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_core_module.html#http) context, specify a [`server`](https://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_core_module.html#server) block that will be responsible for the API:

    ```nginx
    http {
        server {
            # your api configuration will be here
        }
    }
    ```

- Create a [`location`](https://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_core_module.html#location) for API requests and specify the [`api`](https://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_api_module.html#api) directive in this location:

    ```nginx
    http {
        # ...
        server {
            listen 192.168.1.23;
            # ...
            location /api {
                api;
                # ...
            }
        }
    }
    ```

- In order to make changes with the API, such as [resetting statistics counters](#json_delete), managing [upstream servers on-the-fly]({{< relref "../load-balancer/dynamic-configuration-api.md" >}}) or [key-value storage]({{< relref "/nginx/admin-guide/security-controls/denylisting-ip-addresses.md" >}}), managing upstream servers from the [Dashboard](#dashboard_upstream), enable the read-write mode for the API by specifying the `write=on` parameter for the [`api`](https://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_api_module.html#api) directive:

    ```nginx
    http {
        # ...
        server {
            listen 192.168.1.23;
            # ...
            location /api {
                api write=on;
                # ...
            }
        }
    }
    ```

- It is recommended restricting access to the API location, for example, allow access only from local networks with [`allow`](https://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_access_module.html#allow) and [`deny`](https://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_access_module.html#deny) directives:

    ```nginx
    http {
        # ...
        server {
            listen 192.168.1.23;
            # ...
            location /api {
                api write=on;
                allow 192.168.1.0/24;
                deny  all;
            }
        }
    }
    ```

- It is also recommended restricting access to `PATCH`, `POST`, and `DELETE` methods to particular users. This can be done by implementing [`HTTP basic authentication`](https://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_auth_basic_module.html):


    ```nginx
    http {
        # ...
        server {
            listen 192.168.1.23;
            # ...
            location /api {
                limit_except GET {
                    auth_basic "NGINX Plus API";
                    auth_basic_user_file /path/to/passwd/file;
                }
                api   write=on;
                allow 192.168.1.0/24;
                deny  all;
            }
        }
    }
    ```

- Enable the [Dashboard](#dashboard) by specifying the `/dashboard.html` location. By default the Dashboard is located in the root directory (for example, `/usr/share/nginx/html`) specified by the [`root`](https://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_core_module.html#root) directive:

    ```nginx
    http {
        # ...
        server {
            listen 192.168.1.23;
            # ...
            location /api {
                limit_except GET {
                    auth_basic "NGINX Plus API";
                    auth_basic_user_file /path/to/passwd/file;
                }
                api   write=on;
                allow 192.168.1.0/24;
                deny  all;
            }
            location = /dashboard.html {
                root   /usr/share/nginx/html;
            }
        }
    }
    ```

- As an option you can try the [Swagger UI](#swagger_enable) - an interactive documentation tool for the API specification supplied in a OpenAPI YAML file and used with NGINX Plus.
Download the Swagger UI and the OpenAPI YAML specification, specify a [`location`](https://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_core_module.html#location) for them, for example, */swagger-ui*, the path to its files with the [`root`](https://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_core_module.html#root) directive, for example, */usr/share/nginx/html* and limit access to local networks with [`allow`](https://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_access_module.html#allow) and [`deny`](https://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_access_module.html#deny) directives. See [The Swagger UI](#the-swagger-ui) section for details.

    ```nginx
    http {
        # ...

        server {
            listen 192.168.1.23;
            # ...

            location /api {
                limit_except GET {
                    auth_basic "NGINX Plus API";
                    auth_basic_user_file /path/to/passwd/file;
                }

                api   write=on;
                allow 192.168.1.0/24;
                deny  all;
            }

            location = /dashboard.html {
                root   /usr/share/nginx/html;
            }

            location /swagger-ui {
                add_header Content-Security-Policy "default-src 'self'";
                root       /usr/share/nginx/html;
                allow      192.168.1.0/24;
                deny       all;
            }
        }
    }
    ```

## Using the Dashboard

NGINX Plus Dashboard provides a real-time live activity monitoring interface that shows key load and performance metrics of your server infrastructure.

<span id="dashboard_access"></span>
### Accessing the Dashboard

In the address bar of your browser, type-in the address that corresponds to your Dashboard page (in our example  `http://192.168.1.23/dashboard.html`). This will display the Dashboard page located at `/usr/share/nginx/html` as specified in the `root` directive.

There is also a live demo page from NGINX available at [demo.nginx.com/dashboard.html](https://demo.nginx.com/dashboard.html):

[![live activity monitor](/nginx/images/nginx-plus-dashboard-r30-overview-2.png)](https://demo.nginx.com/dashboard.html "Live load-balancing status from NGINX Plus")

<span id="dashboard_tabs"></span>
### Tabs Overview

All information in NGINX Plus Dashboard is represented in tabs.

![The row of tabs at the top of the window on the NGINX Plus dashboard make it easy to drill down to more detailed information about server zones, upstream groups, or the cache](/nginx/images/dashboard-tabs.png)

The **HTTP Zones** tab gives detailed statistics on the frontend performance. Statistics are shown per each [`server`](https://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_core_module.html#server), [`location`](https://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_core_module.html#location) and [`limit_req`](https://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_limit_req_module.html) zones in the [`http`](https://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_core_module.html#http) context. For NGINX Plus to collect information for each server, you must include the [`status_zone`](https://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_api_module.html#status_zone) directive in each `server` or `location` block.  To include charts for `limit_req` limiting, you must configure the [`limit_req_zone`](https://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_limit_req_module.html#limit_req_zone) directive.

![The 'HTTP zones' tab in the NGINX Plus live activity monitoring dashboard displays information about NGINX Plus' interaction with clients](/nginx/images/dashboard-tab-http-zones.png)

TCP and UDP status zones with charts for connection limiting ([`limit_conn`](https://nginx.org/en/docs/stream/ngx_stream_limit_conn_module.html)) appear on the **TCP/UDP Zones** tab.

![The 'TCP/UDP zones' tab in the NGINX Plus live activity monitoring dashboard](/nginx/images/dashboard-tab-tcp-zones.png)

The **HTTP Upstreams** tab provides information about each upstream group for HTTP and HTTPS traffic. TCP and UDP upstream groups appear on the **TCP/UDP Upstreams** tab. For NGINX Plus to collect information for an upstream group, you must include the [`zone`](https://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_upstream_module.html#zone) directive in the [`upstream`](https://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_upstream_module.html#upstream) configuration block.

![The 'Upstreams' tab on the NGINX Plus live activity monitoring dashboard provides information about the servers in each upstream group for HTTP/HTTPS traffic](/nginx/images/dashboard-tab-http-upstreams.png)

The **Caches** tab provides statistics about the caches configured in NGINX Plus. For NGINX Plus to collect information for an upstream group, you must [configure cache]({{< relref "../content-cache/content-caching.md" >}}).

![The 'Caches' tab in the NGINX Plus live activity monitoring dashboard provides information about cache readiness, fullness, and hit ratio](/nginx/images/dashboard-tab-caches.png)

The **Shared Zones** tab shows how much memory is used by each shared memory zone, including cache zones, SSL session cache, upstream zones, keyval zones, session log, sticky sessions, limit_conn and limit_req zones.

![The 'Shared Zones' tab in the NGINX Plus live activity monitoring dashboard provides information about memory usage across all shared memory zones](/nginx/images/dashboard-tab-shared-zones.png)

The **Cluster** tab provides the synchronization status of shared memory zones across all NGINX cluster nodes. See [Runtime State Sharing in a Cluster](https://docs.nginx.com/nginx/admin-guide/high-availability/zone_sync/) for details on how to organize NGINX instances in a cluster and configure synchronization between all cluster nodes.

![The 'Cluster' tab in the NGINX Plus live activity monitoring dashboard provides synchronization information of shared memory zones of NGINX cluster nodes](/nginx/images/dashboard-tab-cluster.png)

The **Resolvers** tab provides DNS server statistics of requests and responses per each DNS status zone. For NGINX Plus to collect information about your DNS servers, include the [`status_zone`](https://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_core_module.html#resolver_status_zone) parameter in the [`resolver`](https://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_core_module.html#resolver) directive.

![The 'Resolvers' tab in the NGINX Plus live activity monitoring dashboard provides information about cache readiness, fullness, and hit ratio](/nginx/images/dashboard-tab-resolvers.png)

The **Workers** tab provides information about worker processes and shows per-worker connection statistics.

![The 'Workers' tab in the NGINX Plus live activity monitoring dashboard provides information about worker processes](/nginx/images/dashboard-tab-workers.png)


<span id="dashboard_upstream"></span>
### Managing Upstream Servers from the Dashboard

You can add new or modify and remove upstream servers directly from the Dashboard interface. Note that you must previously enable the [`api`](https://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_api_module.html#api) in the write mode.

In the **Upstreams** or **TCP/UDP Upstreams** tab, click the pencil icon next to the server name and choose between **Edit selected** and **Add server** buttons:

![In editing mode on the 'Upstreams' tab in the NGINX Plus live activity monitoring dashboard, you can add, remove, or modify servers](https://cdn.wp.nginx.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Screen-Shot-2015-09-08-at-10.31.14-AM.png)

To add an upstream server, click **Add server**:

![The 'Add server' interface for adding servers to an upstream group in the NGINX Plus live activity monitoring dashboard](https://cdn.wp.nginx.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Screen-Shot-2015-09-08-at-10.47.22-AM.png)

To remove or modify an upstream server, click the box to the left of each server’s name, then click **Edit selected**:

![The 'Edit selected' interface for modifying or removing servers in an upstream group in the NGINX Plus live activity monitoring dashboard](/nginx/images/dashboard-r7-edit-server-interface.png)

When finished, click the **Save** button to save the changes.

<span id="dashboard_options"></span>
### Configuring Dashboard Options
You can configure the threshold for Dashboard warnings and alerts by clicking the Gear button in the Tabs menu:

![The 'Dashboard configuration' interface for modifying Dashboard settings](/nginx/images/dashboard-options.png)

**Update every N sec** - updates the Dashboard data after the specified number of seconds, default is `1` second.

**4xx warnings threshold** - represents the ratio between the numbers of `Total` requests and `4xx` errors for `HTTP Upstreams` and `HTTP Zones`. Default is `30%`.

**Calculate hit ratio for the past N sec** - represents all cache hits within the specified number of seconds for `Caches`. Default is `300` seconds.

**Not synced data threshold** - represents the ratio between `Pending` records and `Total` records for `Clusters`. Default is `70%`.

**Resolver errors threshold** - represents the ratio between `Requests` and resolver errors within the time frame specified in **Update every N sec** for `Resolvers`. Default is `3%`.


<span id="json"></span>
## Using the REST API

With NGINX Plus, statistics of your server infrastructure can be managed with the REST API interface. The API is based on standard HTTP requests: statistics can be obtained with `GET` requests and reset with `DELETE` requests. Upstream servers can be added with `POST` requests and modified with `PATCH` requests. See [Managing Upstream Servers with the API]({{< relref "../load-balancer/dynamic-configuration-api.md" >}}) for more information.

The requests are sent in the JSON format that allows you to connect the stats to monitoring tools or dashboards that support JSON.

<span id="json_get"></span>
### Getting statistics with the API

The status information of any element can be accessed with a slash-separated URL. The URL may look as follows:

[`https://demo.nginx.com/api/9/http/caches/http_cache?fields=expired,bypass`](https://demo.nginx.com/api/9/http/caches/http_cache?fields=expired,bypass)

where:

- `/api` is the location you have configured in the NGINX configuration file for the API
- `/9` is the API version, the current API version is `9`
- `/http/caches/http_cache` is the path to the resource
- `?fields=expired,bypass` is an optional argument that specifies which fields of the requested object will be output

The requested information is returned in the JSON data format.

To get the list of all available rootpoints, send the `GET` request with the 'curl' command in terminal (in the example, JSON pretty print extension "json_pp" is used):

```shell
curl -s 'https://demo.nginx.com/api/9/' | json_pp
```

The JSON data returned:

```json
[
   "nginx",
   "processes",
   "connections",
   "slabs",
   "workers",
   "http",
   "stream",
   "resolvers",
   "ssl"
   "workers"
]
```

To get the statistics for a particular endpoint, for example, obtain general information about NGINX, send the following `GET` request:

```shell
curl -s 'https://demo.nginx.com/api/9/nginx' | json_pp
```

The JSON data returned:

```json
{
   "version" : "1.25.1",
   "build" : "nginx-plus-r30",
   "address" : "206.251.255.64",
   "generation" : 14,
   "load_timestamp" : "2023-08-15T10:00:00.114Z",
   "timestamp" : "2023-08-15T14:06:36.475Z",
   "pid" : 2201,
   "ppid" : 92033
}
```

You can specify which fields of the requested object will be output with the optional *fields* argument in the request line. For example, to display only NGINX Plus version and build, specify the command:

```shell
curl -s 'https://demo.nginx.com/api/9/nginx?fields=version,build' | json_pp
```

The JSON data returned:

```json
{
   "version" : "1.25.1",
   "build" : "nginx-plus-r30"
}
```

For a complete list of available endpoints and supported methods see [reference documentation](https://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_api_module.html).

<span id="json_delete"></span>
### Resetting the statistics

Resetting the statistics is performed by sending an API command with the `DELETE` method to a target endpoint. Make sure that your API is configured in the read-write mode.

You can reset the following types of statistics:

- abnormally terminated and respawned child processes
- accepted and dropped client connections
- SSL handshakes and session reuses
- the `reqs` and `fails` metrics for each memory slot
- total client HTTP requests
- accepted and discarded requests, responses, received and sent bytes in a particular HTTP server zone
- cache hits and cache misses in a particular cache zone
- statistics for a particular HTTP or stream upstream server in an upstream server group

For example, to reset the number of abnormally terminated and respawned child processes, you can perform the following command in the terminal via curl:

```shell
curl -X DELETE -i 'http://192.168.1.23/api/9/processes'
```

To reset accepted and dropped client connections perform the following command:

```shell
curl -X DELETE  -i 'http://192.168.1.23/api/9/connections'
```

<span id="api_use"></span>
### Managing Upstream Servers with the API

The NGINX Plus REST API supports `POST` and `PATCH` HTTP methods to dynamically add a server to the upstream group or modify server parameters.

To dynamically change the configuration of an upstream group, send an HTTP request with the appropriate API method. The following examples use the `curl` command, but any mechanism for making HTTP requests is supported. All request bodies and responses are in JSON format.

The URI specifies the following information in this order:

- The hostname or IP address of the node that handles the request (in the following examples, **192.168.1.23**)
- The location where the `api` directive appears (**api**)
- The API version (**9**)
- The name of the upstream group, complete its place in the NGINX Plus configuration hierarchy represented as a slash-separated path (**http/upstreams/appservers**)

For example, to add a new server to the **appservers** upstream group, send the following `curl` command:

```shell
curl -X POST -d '{ \
   "server": "10.0.0.1:8089", \
   "weight": 4, \
   "max_conns": 0, \
   "max_fails": 0, \
   "fail_timeout": "10s", \
   "slow_start": "10s", \
   "backup": true, \
   "down": true \
 }' -s 'http://192.168.1.23/api/9/http/upstreams/appservers/servers'
```

To remove a server from the upstream group:

```shell
curl -X DELETE -s 'http://192.168.1.23/api/9/http/upstreams/appservers/servers/0'
```

To set the `down` parameter for the first server in the group (with ID `0`):

```shell
curl -X PATCH -d '{ "down": true }' -s 'http://192.168.1.23/api/9/http/upstreams/appservers/servers/0'
```

## OpenAPI Specification

NGINX Plus allows you to explore the REST API documentation and send API commands with a graphical user interface. This can be done with the NGINX Plus OpenAPI specification in YAML format and the Swagger UI.

The main purpose of Swagger UI and the YAML OpenAPI spec is to document and visualize NGINX API commands. For security reasons it is not recommended using it in a production environment.

Prior to [NGINX Plus Release 25](https://docs.nginx.com/nginx/releases/#nginxplusrelease-25-r25), the Swagger UI was shipped together with NGINX Plus packages. Since [NGINX Plus Release 26](https://docs.nginx.com/nginx/releases/#nginxplusrelease-26-r26), the OpenAPI YAML specification and the Swagger UI is published separately, below.

Alternatively, copy the link to the appropriate YAML file, and import into your preferred OpenAPI v2 tool.

### Enabling the Swagger UI


To enable the Swagger UI:

1. Install and configure the Swagger UI. The installation package and instructions can be found on the [Swagger UI page](https://swagger.io/tools/swagger-ui/download/).

2. Choose the version of the OpenAPI YAML file that matches your version of NGINX Plus, download the file, and put it to the folder containing the Swagger UI files:

3. Configure NGINX Plus to work with the Swagger UI. Create a [`location`](https://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_core_module.html#location), for example, */swagger-ui*:

    ```nginx
    location /swagger-ui {
        # ...
    }
    ```

2. Specify the path to the Swagger UI files and the YAML spec with the [`root`](https://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_core_module.html#root) directive, for example, to `usr/share/nginx/html`:

    ```nginx
    location /swagger-ui {
        root   /usr/share/nginx/html;
        # ...
    }
    ```

   For NGINX Plus Release 25 and earlier, the Swagger UI is located in the root directory specified by the [`root`](https://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_core_module.html#root) directive, for example, */usr/share/nginx/html*.


3. Restrict access to this location only from a local network with [`allow`](https://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_access_module.html#allow) and [`deny`](https://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_access_module.html#deny) directives:

    ```nginx
    location /swagger-ui {
        root   /usr/share/nginx/html;
        allow  192.168.1.0/24;
        deny   all;
    }
    ```

4. It is also recommended enabling Content Security Policy headers that define that all resources are loaded from the same origin as Swagger UI with the [`add_header`](https://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_headers_module.html#add_header) directive:

    ```nginx
    location /swagger-ui {
        add_header Content-Security-Policy "default-src 'self'";
        root       /usr/share/nginx/html;
        allow      192.168.1.0/24;
        deny       all;
    }
    ```

<span id="swagger_disable"></span>
### Disabling the Swagger UI

In NGINX Plus Release 25 and earlier, the Swagger UI is a part of NGINX Plus package and is installed by default. For [security reasons](https://support.f5.com/csp/article/K73710094), you may want to block access to the Swagger UI. One of the ways to do it is to [return](https://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_rewrite_module.html#return) the `404` status code in response to the URL that matches the `/swagger-ui` location:

```nginx
location /swagger-ui {
    return 404;
}
```

<span id="swagger_access"></span>
### Using the Swagger UI

To access the Swagger UI page:

- In the address bar of your browser, type-in the address of Swagger UI, in our example the address is *<http://192.168.1.23/swagger-ui/>*:

![Swagger UI](/nginx/images/swagger-ui.png)

- If you have configured the HTTPS protocol for the Swagger UI page, you will need to choose the "HTTPS" scheme in the "Schemes" menu.

- Click on the operation you want to fulfil.

- Click **Try it out**.

- Fill in the obligatory fields, if required. Generally, the required field is the name of the shared memory zone.

- As an option you can display only particular fields. In the "Fields" line specify the fields you want to be displayed separated by commas. If no fields are specified, then all fields are displayed.

- Click **Execute**. The result and the corresponding HTTP error code will be displayed below the **Execute** command.

### API and Swagger UI Live Examples

NGINX provides live examples of JSON data and Swagger UI on a demo website.

Live example of JSON data is available at: <https://demo.nginx.com/api/8/>

You can send an API command with curl or with a browser:

```shell
curl -s 'https://demo.nginx.com/api/9/'
curl -s 'https://demo.nginx.com/api/9/nginx?fields=version,build'
curl -s 'https://demo.nginx.com/api/9/http/caches/http_cache'
curl -s 'https://demo.nginx.com/api/9/http/upstreams/'
curl -s 'https://demo.nginx.com/api/9/http/upstreams/demo-backend'
curl -s 'https://demo.nginx.com/api/9/http/upstreams/demo-backend/servers/0'
```

The Swagger UI demo page is available at: <https://demo.nginx.com/swagger-ui/>

[![Swagger UI](/nginx/images/swagger-ui.png)](https://demo.nginx.com/swagger-ui)

Live examples operate in the read-only mode, resetting the statistics via the `DELETE` method and creating/modifying upstream servers with the `POST`/`PATCH` methods are not available. Also note that as the demo API is served over the HTTP protocol, it is required to choose the “HTTP” scheme in the “Schemes” menu on the [Swagger UI demo page](https://demo.nginx.com/swagger-ui/).
