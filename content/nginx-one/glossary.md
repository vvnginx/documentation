This glossary defines terms used in the F5 NGINX One Console and F5 Distributed Cloud.

| Term        | Definition |
|-------------|-------------|
| **Config Sync Group** | A group of NGINX systems (or instances) with identical configurations. They may also share the same certificates. However, the instances in a Config Sync Group could belong to different systems and even different clusters. For more information, see this explanation of [Important considerations]({{< relref "/nginx-one/how-to/config-sync-groups/manage-config-sync-groups.md#important-considerations" >}}) |
| **Data Plane** | The data plane is the part of a network architecture that carries user traffic. It handles tasks like forwarding data packets between devices and managing network communication. In the context of NGINX, the data plane is responsible for tasks such as load balancing, caching, and serving web content. |
| **Instance** | An instance is an individual system with NGINX installed. You can group the instances of your choice in a Config Sync Group. When you add an instance to NGINX One, you need to use a data plane key. | 
| **Namespace** | In F5 Distributed Cloud, a namespace groups a tenantâ€™s configuration objects, similar to administrative domains. Every object in a namespace must have a unique name, and each namespace must be unique to its tenant. This setup ensures isolation, preventing cross-referencing of objects between namespaces. |
| **Tenant** | A tenant in F5 Distributed Cloud is an entity that owns a specific set of configuration and infrastructure. It is fundamental for isolation, meaning a tenant cannot access objects or infrastructure of other tenants. Tenants can be either individual or enterprise, with the latter allowing multiple users with role-based access control (RBAC). |
