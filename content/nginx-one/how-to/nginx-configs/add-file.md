## Overview

{{< include "nginx-one/add-file/overview.md" >}}

## Before you start

Before you add files in your configuration, ensure:

- You have access to the NGINX One Console.
- NGINX instances are properly registered with NGINX One Console

## Important considerations

If your instance is a member of a Config Sync Group, changes that you make may be synchronized to other instances in that group.
For more information, see how you can [Manage Config Sync Groups]({{< relref "/nginx-one/how-to/config-sync-groups/manage-config-sync-groups.md" >}}).

## Add a file

You can use the NGINX One Console to add a file to a specific instance. To do so:

1. Select the instance to manage.
1. Select the **Configuration** tab.

   {{< /tip >}}

1. Select **Edit Configuration**.
1. In the **Edit Configuration** window that appears, select **Add File**.

You now have multiple options, described in the sections which follow.

### New Configuration File

Enter the name of the desired configuration file, such as `abc.conf` and select **Add**. The configuration file appears in the **Edit Configuration** window.

### New SSL Certificate or CA Bundle

  Make sure to specify the path to your certificate in your NGINX configuration,
  with the `ssl_certificate` and `ssl_certificate_key` directives.
