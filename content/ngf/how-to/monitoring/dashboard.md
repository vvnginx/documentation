Learn how to view the NGINX Plus dashboard to see real-time metrics.

## Overview

The NGINX Plus dashboard offers a real-time live activity monitoring interface that shows key load and performance metrics of your server infrastructure. The dashboard is enabled by default for NGINX Gateway Fabric deployments that use NGINX Plus as the data plane. The dashboard is available on port 8765.

To access the dashboard:

1. Use port-forwarding to forward connections to port 8765 on your local machine to port 8765 on the NGINX Gateway Fabric pod (replace `<nginx-gateway-fabric-pod>` with the actual name of the pod).

    ```shell
    kubectl port-forward <nginx-gateway-fabric-pod> 8765:8765 -n nginx-gateway
    ```

1. Open your browser to [http://127.0.0.1:8765/dashboard.html](http://127.0.0.1:8765/dashboard.html) to access the dashboard.

The dashboard will look like this:

{{< note >}} The [API](https://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_api_module.html) used by the dashboard for metrics is also accessible using the `/api` path. {{< /note >}}

### Configure dashboard access through NginxProxy

To allow access to the NGINX Plus dashboard from different sources than the default `127.0.0.1`, we can use the NginxProxy resource
to allow access to other IP Addresses or CIDR blocks.

The following NginxProxy configuration allows access to the NGINX Plus dashboard from the IP Addresses `192.0.2.8` and 
`192.0.2.0` and the CIDR block `198.51.100.0/24`:

```yaml
apiVersion: gateway.nginx.org/v1alpha1
kind: NginxProxy
metadata:
   name: ngf-proxy-config
spec:
   nginxPlus:
      allowedAddresses:
         - type: IPAddress
           value: 192.0.2.8
         - type: IPAddress
           value: 192.0.2.0
         - type: CIDR
           value: 198.51.100.0/24
```

For more information on configuring the NginxProxy resource, visit our [data plane configuration]({{< ref "data-plane-configuration.md" >}}) document
which explains how to either configure an NginxProxy resource on installation, manually create an NginxProxy resource, or edit an existing NginxProxy resource.
