**Note:** Refer to the [F5 NGINX Controller Technical Specifications]({{< relref "/controller/admin-guides/install/nginx-controller-tech-specs.md" >}}) guide to find out which distributions are supported for use with NGINX Controller and NGINX Controller Agent.

## Setup

Before proceeding, you should review the [Prerequisites]({{< relref "/nap-waf/v4/admin-guide/install#prerequisites" >}}), [Platform Security Considerations]({{< relref "/nap-waf/v4/admin-guide/install#platform-security-considerations" >}}) and [User Permissions]({{< relref "/nap-waf/v4/admin-guide/install#user-permissions" >}}) sections of the NGINX App Protect WAF Admin Guide.


## Install NGINX App Protect WAF

**Note:** If a version of NGINX App Protect WAF prior to 3.6 is required, please contact the NGINX Sales team to assist with this configuration.

1. If you already have NGINX packages in your system, back up your configs and logs:

   ```shell
   sudo cp -a /etc/nginx /etc/nginx-plus-backup
   sudo cp -a /var/log/nginx /var/log/nginx-plus-backup
   ```

2. Create the `/etc/ssl/nginx/` directory:

   ```shell
   sudo mkdir -p /etc/ssl/nginx
   ```

3. Log in to the [NGINX Customer Portal](https://my.f5.com) and download the following two files:

   ```shell
   nginx-repo.key
   nginx-repo.crt
   ```

   **See Also:** You can use the [NGINX Controller REST API to download the key and cert files]({{< relref "/controller/admin-guides/install/get-n-plus-cert-and-key" >}}).

4. Copy the above two files to the CentOS server's `/etc/ssl/nginx/` directory. Use an SCP client or another secure file transfer tool to perform this task.

5. Install prerequisite packages:

   ```shell
   sudo yum install ca-certificates epel-release wget
   ```

6. Remove any previously downloaded NGINX Plus repository file from /etc/yum.repos.d:

   ```shell
   sudo rm /etc/yum.repos.d/nginx-plus-*.repo
   ```

7. Add NGINX Plus repository by downloading the file nginx-plus-7.4.repo to /etc/yum.repos.d:

   ```shell
   sudo wget -P /etc/yum.repos.d https://cs.nginx.com/static/files/nginx-plus-7.4.repo
   ```

8. Add NGINX App Protect WAF repository by downloading the file app-protect-7.repo to /etc/yum.repos.d:

   ```shell
   sudo wget -P /etc/yum.repos.d https://cs.nginx.com/static/files/app-protect-7.repo
   ```

9. If NGINX Plus or NGINX App Protect WAF was previously installed on the system, clean up package manager cache information:

   ```shell
   sudo yum clean all
   ```

10. Install the latest NGINX App Protect WAF package.

      **See Also:** Please refer to [NGINX App Protect Compatibility Matrix]({{< relref "/controller/admin-guides/install/nginx-controller-tech-specs.md#nginx-app-protect-compatibility-matrix" >}}) for specific version compatibility.

      If you wish to install a specific version, please replace `app-protect` with the target version, for example `app-protect-25+3.671.0`:

      ```shell
      sudo yum install app-protect
      ```

11. Check the NGINX binary version to ensure that you have NGINX Plus installed correctly:

      ```shell
      sudo nginx -v
      ```

12. Configure SELinux as appropriate per your organization’s security policies. NGINX App Protect WAF applies the prebuilt SELinux policy module during the installation. If you encounter any issues, check the [Troubleshooting Guide]({{< relref "/nap-waf/v4/troubleshooting-guide/troubleshooting#selinux" >}}).

      **Note:** NGINX Controller has specific [requirements regarding SELinux configuration]({{< relref "/controller/admin-guides/install/nginx-controller-tech-specs.md#supported-distributions" >}}).

13. Start the NGINX service:

      ```shell
      sudo systemctl start nginx
      ```

14. Start the `bd_agent` service (for Controller ADC Agent 3.20.1 or Controller APIM Agent 3.19.2 only)

      If you plan to use this instance with Controller ADC Agent 3.20.1 or Controller APIM Agent 3.19.2, you need to start the `bd_agent`:

      ```shell
      /bin/su -s /bin/bash -c '/opt/app_protect/bin/bd_agent &' nginx
      ```

15. Verify NGINX Plus and BD processes are running:

      ```shell
      ps -ef | grep nginx
      ps -ef | grep bd
      ```

      **Note:** If you plan to use this instance with Controller ADC Agent 3.20.1 or Controller APIM Agent 3.19.2, also verify that `bd_agent` is running:

      ```shell
      ps -ef | grep bd_agent
      ```

16. To upgrade your signature package to the latest version and obtain the best protection, refer to [Updating App Protect Attack Signatures]({{< relref "/nap-waf/v4/admin-guide/install#centos--rhel-74--amazon-linux-2">}}).
