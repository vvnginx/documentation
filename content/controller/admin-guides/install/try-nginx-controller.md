## Install NGINX Controller Prerequisites

{{< include "controller/helper-script-prereqs.md" >}}

&nbsp;

---

## Install NGINX Controller

Install NGINX Controller on a dedicated node that **does not** already have Kubernetes configured. NGINX Controller does not support pre-configured Kubernetes implementations at this time. The installer for NGINX Controller will install and configure Kubernetes for you.

{{< important >}}Before installing NGINX Controller, you must **disable swap on the host**; this is required by Kubernetes in order for the kubelet to work properly. Refer to your Linux distribution documentation for specific instructions for disabling swap for your system. For more information about this requirement, see the AskF5 knowledge base article [K82655201](https://support.f5.com/csp/article/K82655201) and the [kubeadm installation guide](https://kubernetes.io/docs/setup/production-environment/tools/kubeadm/install-kubeadm/#before-you-begin) in the Kubernetes documentation.{{< /important >}}

{{< caution >}}**For RHEL 8 deployments**, complete the additional prerequisite steps in the [Installing NGINX on RHEL 8]({{< relref "/controller/admin-guides/install/install-nginx-controller-rhel-8.md" >}}) guide before installing NGINX Controller. RHEL 8 support is a **beta** feature.{{< /caution >}}

To install NGINX Controller, take the following steps:

1. Download the NGINX Controller installer package from the [MyF5 Customer Portal](https://my.f5.com/manage/s/downloads).
1. Extract the installer package files:

    ```bash
    tar xzf controller-installer-<version>.tar.gz
    ```

1. Run the installation script:

    ```bash
    cd controller-installer
    ./install.sh
    ```

1. When prompted to use an embedded config DB, type `y`.

1. The installation script walks through a series of steps and asks for the following inputs:

    - **Config database volume type**: Specify the type of volume to use to store the config database: local, NFS, or AWS. We recommend choosing `local` for demo and trial purposes.

      {{< see-also >}}Refer to the [NGINX Controller Technical Specifications Guide]({{< relref "/controller/admin-guides/install/nginx-controller-tech-specs.md#local-or-external-storage" >}}) for more information about the volume options and requirements.{{< /see-also >}}

    - **Analytics database volume type**: Specify the type of volume to use to store the analytics database: local, NFS, or AWS. We recommend choosing `local` for demo and trial purposes.
    - **EULA**: Read the end-user license agreement. Type either `y` to accept or `n` to exit.
    - **SMTP**
      - **SMTP Host**: Provide the host name or IP address of an SMTP server. This is used to send password recovery emails. For trial purposes, if you don't need to receive these communications, you can enter a value of "example.com" or something similar.
      - **SMTP Port**: The port of the SMTP server.
      - **SMTP Authentication**: Select `y` or `n` to authenticate when connecting to the SMTP server.
      - **Use TLS for SMTP Communication**: Select `y` or `n` to use SSL for SMTP server connections.
      - **Do not reply email address**: The sender's email address. For example, `donotreply@example.com`.
    - **Admin**
      - **First name**: The first name for the initial admin user.
      - **Last name**: The last name for the initial admin user.
      - **Email address**: The contact email address for the initial admin user.
      - **Password**: The initial admin's password. Passwords must be 6-64 characters long and must include letters and digits.
    - **FQDN**: Fully qualified domain name (FQDN) -- a resolvable domain name for the NGINX Controller server. You can use the FQDN to access the NGINX Controller web interface.
      Additionally, the FQDN is used by Controller Agents when connecting to NGINX Controller.
    - **SSL/TLS certificates**: Type `y` to generate and use self-signed certs for running NGINX Controller over HTTPS, or type `n` to provide your own certs.

        {{< important >}}
If you provide your own SSL/TLS certificates, you'll need a complete certificate chain file, with the intermediate CA cert appended to the server cert; the server certificate must appear **before** the chained certificates in the combined file.
        {{< /important >}}

1. Log in to NGINX Controller at `https://<Controller-FQDN>/login`. Use the admin email address and password that you provided during the installation process.

1. Once NGINX Controller is installed, you may safely delete the installer package that you downloaded and extracted.

## License NGINX Controller

To add a license to NGINX Controller, take the following steps:

1. Go to `https://<Controller-FQDN>/platform/license` and log in.
1. In the **Upload a license** section, select an upload option:

    - **Upload license file** -- Locate and select your license file in the file explorer.
    - **Paste your Association Token or license file** -- Paste your customer Association Token or the contents of your NGINX Controller license file. These are available on the [MyF5 Customer Portal](https://account.f5.com/myf5).

1. Select **Save license**.

{{< see-also >}}
To add a license using the [NGINX Controller REST API]({{< relref "/controller/api/_index.md" >}}), send a PUT request to the `/platform/license` endpoint. Provide your CAT or NGINX Controller license as a base64-encoded string in the JSON request body.

## Install NGINX Plus

### Prerequisites

- Make sure to review the [NGINX Plus Technical Specifications Guide](https://docs.nginx.com/nginx/technical-specs/) for the requirements for your distribution and desired configuration.
- You'll need the NGINX Plus certificate and public key files (`nginx-repo.crt` and `nginx-repo.key`) that were provided when you signed up for the trial license. If you don't have these files, you can use the [NGINX Controller REST API]({{< relref "/controller/api/_index.md" >}}) to download them.

#### How to Download the NGINX Plus Cert and Key using the NGINX Controller API

The NGINX Controller API uses session cookies to authenticate requests. The session cookie is returned in response to a `GET /api/v1/platform/login` request. See the Login endpoint in the [NGINX Controller API Reference]({{< relref "/controller/api/_index.md" >}}) documentation for information about session cookie timeouts and invalidation.

{{< tip >}}
You can send a GET request to the login endpoint to find the status of the session token.
{{< /tip >}}

For example:

- Login and capture the session cookie:

  ```curl
  curl -c cookie.txt -X POST --url 'https://198.51.100.10/api/v1/platform/login' --header 'Content-Type: application/json' --data '{"credentials": {"type": "BASIC","username": "arthur@example.net","password": "<password>"}}'
  ```

- Use the session cookie to authenticate and get the session status:

  ```curl
  curl -b cookie.txt -c cookie.txt -X GET --url 'https://198.51.100.10/api/v1/platform/login'
  ```


<br>

To use the [NGINX Controller REST API]({{< relref "/controller/api/_index.md" >}}) to download your NGINX Plus certificate and key bundle as a gzip or JSON file, send a GET request to the `/platform/licenses/nginx-plus-licenses/controller-provided` endpoint.

For example:

- Download JSON file:

  ```bash
  curl -b cookie.txt -c cookie.txt --header 'Content-Type: application/json' -X GET --url 'https://192.0.2.0/api/v1/platform/licenses/nginx-plus-licenses/controller-provided'  --output nginx-plus-certs.json
  ```

- Download GZIP file:

  ```bash
  curl -b cookie.txt -c cookie.txt -X GET --url 'https://192.0.2.0/api/v1/platform/licenses/nginx-plus-licenses/controller-provided' --output nginx-plus-certs.gz
  ```

{{< note >}}
If you are using a self-signed certificate you will need to add `-k` (allow insecure connections) to your curl command to be able to download your NGINX Plus certificate and key bundle.
{{< /note >}}


Once you have downloaded your certificate and key bundle you will need to expand the `.gz` file to get your certificate and key pair.

For example:

```bash
gunzip nginx-plus-certs.gz
```

### Steps

Take the following steps to install NGINX Plus:

{{< important >}}
You need the NGINX Plus certificate and public key files (`nginx-repo.crt` and `nginx-repo.key`) that were provided when you signed up for the trial license.
{{< /important >}}

1. First, make sure to review the [NGINX Plus Technical Specifications Guide](https://docs.nginx.com/nginx/technical-specs/) for the requirements for your distribution and desired configuration.
2. To install NGINX Plus, follow the instructions in the [NGINX Plus Installation Guide](https://docs.nginx.com/nginx/admin-guide/installing-nginx/installing-nginx-plus/). Refer to the relevant section for your distribution.
