## Overview

After installing F5 NGINX Controller, you should back up the cluster config and encryption keys. You'll need these if you ever need to restore the NGINX config database on top of a new NGINX Controller installation.

- To back up the NGINX Controller cluster configuration and encryption keys:

  ```bash
  /opt/nginx-controller/helper.sh cluster-config save
  ```

  The file is saved to `/opt/nginx-controller/cluster-config.tgz`.

- To restore the cluster's config and encryption keys, take the following steps:

  ```bash
  /opt/nginx-controller/helper.sh cluster-config load <filename>
  ```

{{< versions "3.12" "latest" "ctrlvers" >}}
{{< versions "3.18" "latest" "apimvers" >}}
{{< versions "3.20" "latest" "adcvers" >}}
