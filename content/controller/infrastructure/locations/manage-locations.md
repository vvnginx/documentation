## Overview

You can logically group your NGINX instances and instance groups by their physical locations using the **Locations** settings page in the F5 NGINX Controller web interface.

{{< note >}}
By default, NGINX Instances are added to the `unspecified` Location. The unspecified Location is a system-owned resource that canâ€™t be updated or deleted.
