## Overview

[Alerts]({{< relref "/controller/analytics/alerts/about-alerts.md" >}}) are notifications about the F5 NGINX Controller system and your applications' performance.

[Alert rules]({{< relref "/controller/analytics/alerts/about-alerts.md#alert-rules" >}}) let you specify what you want to be alerted about. This includes which metrics you want to monitor; the trigger conditions and threshold to meet; the instance(s) to monitor; and the email address(es) to use for notifications.

## Add an Alert Rule

To add an alert rule:

1. Open the NGINX Controller user interface and log in.
1. On the Analytics menu, select **Alerts > Alert Rules**.
1. Select **Create Alert Rule**.
1. Define your alert rule by providing the following information:

   - Name
   - (Optional) Display Name
   - Metric
   - Condition, Threshold, and Time Period
   - Filter
   - (Optional) Breakout
   - Email Notification Address(es):

     - Select the desired address(es) from the list provided, or
     - Select **Manage Email Addresses** to add a new address, then take the steps below:

       1. Select **Add Email Address**.
