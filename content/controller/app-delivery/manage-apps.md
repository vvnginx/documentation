## Overview

Follow the steps in this topic to learn how to create and manage Apps and App Components.

{{< tip >}}You can also use the F5 NGINX Controller API to create Apps and Components. See the [NGINX Controller API Reference]({{< relref "/controller/api/_index.md" >}}) for details.{{< /tip >}}
&nbsp;

## Before You Begin

You will need to select an [Environment]({{< relref "/controller/services/manage-environments.md#create-an-environment" >}}) and [Gateway]({{< relref "/controller/services/manage-gateways.md#create-a-gateway" >}}) -- or create new Environment and Gateway resources -- when adding a new App.

{{< note >}}If you do not have permission to create these resources and none are available to select, contact your system administrator.{{< /note >}}
&nbsp;

## Create an App

To create an App:

1. Open the NGINX Controller user interface and log in.
1. Select the NGINX Controller menu icon, then select **Services**.
1. On the **Services** menu, select **Apps**.
1. On the **Apps** menu, select **Create App**.
1. On the **Create App** page, provide the following information:
   - Name
   - Environment
   - Description (Optional)
   - Display Name (Optional)
   - Tags (Optional)
1. Select **Submit**.

## Create a Component

1. On the **Services** menu, select **Apps**.
1. On the **Apps** menu, in the **Recent Apps** section, select the name of the App that you want to add the Component to.
1. On the Overview page for your App, select **Create Component**.
1. Then, complete each of the configuration sections as needed:

   - [General Configuration](#general-configuration)
   - [URIs](#uris)
   - [Workload Groups](#workload-groups)
   - [Ingress](#ingress)
   - [Backend](#backend)

## Configuration Options

### General Configuration

On the **Create App Component** *Configuration* page:

1. Select the App Component Type:

    - Web
    - TCP/UDP

1. Provide the name for your Component.
1. (Optional) Provide a Display Name.
1. (Optional) Provide a Description.
1. (Optional) Add any desired tags.
1. (Optional) Select a **Gateway Ref** or select **Create Gateway Ref** to create a new Gateway.
1. Select **Next**.

### URIs

A Component definition must contain one or more URIs.

**Web Component URIs** can be either of the following:

- a complete URI that follows the format `<schema://host>[:port][/path]`, or
- a relative path that follows the format `</path>[/...]`.

Relative paths inherit the host URI configured for the Gateway associated with the Component.
The host and relative path(s) defined for a Component take precedence over the host defined in the associated Gateway.

Example Web URI definitions:

- `http://www.f5.com:8080/sales`
- `http://*.f5.com:5050/test`
- `/images`
- `/*.jpg`
- `/locations/us/wa*`

**TCP/UDP URIs** must be a complete URI that follows the format `<tcp|udp|tcp+tls://*|IP:port|portRange>`.
TCP+TLS URIs can include TLS information.

Example TCP/UDP URI definitions:

- `tcp://192.168.1.1:12345`
- `tcp+tls://192.168.1.1:12346`
- `tcp://192.168.1.1:12345-12350`
- `tcp://*:12345`
- `udp://192.168.1.1:12345`
- `udp://*:12345`

On the **Create App Component** *URIs* page:

1. Define the **URIs**:

    - Select **Add URI**.
    - In the **URI** box, type the URI for the Component.
    - (Optional) Select a **Match Method** (applicable only to Web Components).
    - (Optional) Select **Customize for this URI** to add custom **TLS Settings**.

        {{< note >}}
TLS Settings can be inherited from the Gateway, or customized at the Component level. Enable this option if you want the Component to use a different cert than that used by the Gateway.
        {{< /note >}}

1. (Optional) Define the **Shared TLS Settings**.

    - To use a cert that is already associated with the Gateway, select it from the list.
    - To add a new shared cert, select **Create New**.

1. Select **Next**.

### Workload Groups

On the **Create App Component** *Workload Groups* page:

1. Provide a Workload Group Name.
1. (Optional) Select a Location.

   The location determines which instances or instance groups the workload group is applied to. If any workload group specifies a location, they all must specify a location. Note: If the associated gateway uses instance groups, the location should refer to the instance group location, not the location(s) of the individual instances that make up that group.

   {{< see-also >}}Refer to the [Manage Locations]({{< relref "/controller/infrastructure/locations/manage-locations.md" >}}) topic for more information.{{< /see-also >}}
1. Define the backend workload URIs.
1. (Optional) Define the DNS Server.
1. (Optional) Select the Load Balancing Method. The default value is "Round Robin".

   {{< see-also >}}Refer to the [NGINX Plus Admin Guide](https://docs.nginx.com/nginx/admin-guide/load-balancer/http-load-balancer/) for more information about the available options.{{< /see-also >}}

1. (Optional) Select the Session Persistence Type (applicable only to Web Components).
1. (Optional) Select the Desired Proxy Settings (applicable only to Web Components).

1. Select **Next** to go to the next page, or **Submit** to save and submit your changes.

### Snippets

{{< note >}}
Introduced in NGINX Controller App Delivery module v3.22.
{{< /note >}}

Refer to the [About Snippets]({{< relref "/controller/app-delivery/about-snippets.md" >}}) topic to learn more about Snippets and how they impact the NGINX Controller-generated `nginx.conf` file.

On the **Create App Component** *Snippets* page:

1. Select the appropriate snippet type:

    - *Add URI Snippet*: Adds NGINX directives to the component's `server` and `location` blocks.
    - *Add Workload Group Snippet*: Adds NGINX directives to the component's `upstream` block(s).

1. Paste or type the desired snippet into the text field.

   Snippets should follow the standard `nginx.conf` format.
   For example, the below URI snippet adds the `proxy_set_header` directive to the component's `server` block.

   ```Nginx configuration file
   proxy_set_header Host $proxy_host;
   ```

   {{< caution >}}When you use Snippets to customize your NGINX configuration, your changes are applied to the `nginx.conf` file *as is*. NGINX Controller does not verify that your configuration is valid before applying the snippet. We strongly recommend verifying Snippets in a lab environment before making any changes in production.{{< /caution >}}

1. Select **Next** to preview the REST API call for your component, or **Submit** to save and submit your changes.

### Rate Limiting

1. Select options for Rate and Units.
1. (Optional) Select options for Excess Request Processing and Ignore Initial N Requests.
1. Select options for Reject Status Code.
1. Select **Next**.

1. Select **Add Authentication**.
1. Select an [**Identity Provider**]({{< relref "/controller/services/manage-identity-providers.md" >}}).
1. Select a **Credential Location**.
1. (Optional) Enable [**Conditional Access**]({{< relref "/controller/services/available-policies.md#conditional-access" >}}).
1. Select **Next**.

### Security

On the **Create App Component** *Security* page:

{{< note >}} The following Security settings are applicable only to Web components. {{< /note >}}

1. (Optional) Select **Enable Web Application Firewall (WAF)** to watch for or block suspicious requests or attacks.
1. (Optional) Select **Monitor Only** to allow traffic to pass without being rejected. Security events are still generated and metrics are still collected. Refer to [About App Security Analytics]({{< relref "/controller/analytics/view-app-security-analytics.md#overview" >}}) for more information.
1. (Optional) the signature(s) that you want the WAF to ignore. You can specify multiple signatures as a comma-separated list.
1. Select **Next**.

{{< see-also >}}
Refer to the [Secure Your Apps]({{< relref "/controller/app-delivery/security/_index.md" >}}) topics to learn more about WAF and the default protections provided by NGINX App Protect.
