|Problem|Solution|
|-------|--------|
| Starting version 3.12, installation steps and Docker deployment examples were changed in the [Admin Guide]({{< relref "/nap-waf/v4/admin-guide/install.md" >}}). You may encounter one of the following error messages:<br><br># example of yum installation error when the app-protect-security-updates repository is missing:<br><pre><code>`Error: Package: app-protect-compiler-1.234.0-1.el7.ngx.x86_64 (app-protect)`<br>`Requires: app-protect-attack-signatures`<br>`Error: Package: app-protect-compiler-1.234.0-1.el7.ngx.x86_64 (app-protect)`<br>`Requires: app-protect-threat-campaigns`</code></pre><br># example of apt installation error when the app-protect-security-updates repository is missing:<br><pre><code>`The following packages have unmet dependencies:`<br>`app-protect-compiler : Depends: app-protect-attack-signatures`<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; `Depends: app-protect-threat-campaigns`<br>`Error: Unable to correct problems, you have held broken packages.`</pre></code>| Enable the [app-protect-security-updates repository]({{< relref "/nap-waf/v4/admin-guide/install.md#updating-app-protect-attack-signatures" >}}). |

### Configuration

|Problem|Solution|
|-------|--------|
| NGINX is not running (ps -aux)<br><br> Reloading NGINX fails| Check the error log at `/var/log/nginx/error.log`<br>Fix the problem and re-run NGINX. |
| NGINX App Protect WAF functionality is not as expected| NGINX App Protect WAF has several logs which can be used for troubleshooting. <br> Usually, it is best to look for any warning or error messages within the logs. <br> Refer to [Logs Overview]({{< relref  "/nap-waf/v4/logging-overview/logs-overview.md">}}) |
| `Too many open files` error message | Increase number of file descriptors. <br> For example: `worker_rlimit_nofile 65535;` in the main context of `nginx.conf` file. <br> Refer to [worker_rlimit_nofile directive](https://www.nginx.com/blog/using-nginx-plus-with-selinux/#Issue-4:-%3Ccode%3EToo-many-files-are-open%3C/code%3E-Error)|
| `setrlimit ... failed (Permission denied)` error message | Increase the limit using the following command as the root user:<br> `setsebool -P httpd_setrlimit 1;` <br> Refer to [Issue 4: Too many files are open Error](https://www.nginx.com/blog/using-nginx-plus-with-selinux/#Issue-4:-%3Ccode%3EToo-many-files-are-open%3C/code%3E-Error) |
| unknown directive `app_protect_xxx` error message  | App Protect module is not loaded. Add this line to the main (global) context of nginx.conf:<br>`load_module "/etc/nginx/modules/ngx_http_app_protect_module.so";`  |

{{</bootstrap-table>}}

## ELK issues

ELK issues are addressed directly in GitHub by posting the issue to [Kibana dashboards for F5 App Protect WAF GitHub repo](https://github.com/464d41/f5-waf-elk-dashboards).

## SELinux
App Protect files and processes are labeled with the following two contexts:

- `nap-compiler_t`
- `nap-engine_t`

NGINX Plus is labeled with the `httpd_t` context.

If you run into a situation where SELinux denies access to something, start the troubleshooting by searching for audit denials related to one of the above contexts.

For example:

```none
ausearch --start recent -m avc --raw -se nap-engine_t
```

> `--start recent` here means to start the search from 10 minutes ago

## Opening a Support Ticket

In order to open a support ticket, collect the troubleshooting information in a tarball and send it to your customer support engineer.

 1. Tarball preparation to collect data for troubleshooting:
     - Get all versions via:

     ```none
     cat /opt/app_protect/VERSION /opt/app_protect/RELEASE > package_versions.txt
     ```

     For CentOS:

     ```none
     rpm -qa nginx-plus* app-protect* >> package_versions.txt
     ```

     For Debian:

     ```none
     apt list --installed | grep -E 'nginx-plus|app-protect' >> package_versions.txt
     ```

     - Get OS via:

     ```none
     cat /etc/os-release > system_version.txt && uname -r >> system_version.txt && cat /proc/version >> system_version.txt
     ```

 2. Create a list of files for tarball in a file called logs.txt:
     - `package_versions.txt`
     - `system_version.txt`
     - `/var/log/app_protect/*` (all app protect files)
     - `/var/log/nginx/*` (all NGINX files)

 3. Add all policies and log file configuration

 4. Add all nginx configuration including all references such as `/etc/nginx/nginx.conf`

 5. Create the tarball:

     ```none
     tar cvfz logs.tgz `cat logs.txt`
     ```

 7. Attach `logs.tgz` to support ticket.

 8. On the support ticket, in the NGINX App Protect WAF, set the release version according to the `opt/app_protect/RELEASE` file.
