## Overview

The operation logs consists of system operational and health events. The events are sent to the NGINX error log and are distinguished by the `APP_PROTECT_DOS` prefix followed by JSON body. The log level depends on the event: success is usually `notice` while failure is `error`. The timestamp is inherent in the error log.

## Events

{{<bootstrap-table "table table-bordered table-striped table-responsive table-sm">}}

|Event Type|Level|Meaning|
|--------- |-----|------ |
|Configuration Error |error |There were errors in the [directives]({{< relref "/nap-dos/directives-and-policy/learn-about-directives-and-policy.md" >}}) in the `nginx.conf` file. <br> Configuration error event is produced when one of F5 NGINX App Protect DoS directives is supplied with an incorrect data. An additional information will be added to the message, describing what was incorrect. NGINX will run with default values for this directive. <br> Please note that if the directive supplied with an incorrect number of arguments then NGINX will issue an error and NGINX will not run. It is a generic NGINX behavior.|
