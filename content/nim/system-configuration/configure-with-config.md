## Overview

This guide explains how to configure F5 NGINX Instance Manager by editing the **/etc/nms/nms.conf** file.

## Before you start

Before you set up NGINX Instance Manager, ensure:

- You have access to the **/etc/nms/nms.conf** file on the host where NGINX Instance Manager is installed.
- You understand the required settings and options.
- You have the necessary permissions to edit the configuration file.

## Configuration details

Edit the **/etc/nms/nms.conf** file to configure NGINX Instance Manager. The comments in the example configuration file provide details on each setting and its usage.

### Example nms.conf with default settings and values
