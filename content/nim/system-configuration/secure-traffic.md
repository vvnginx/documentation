## Overview

This guide explains how to secure client connections to NGINX Instance Manager and protect traffic between NGINX Instance Manager and NGINX instances.

With NGINX Plus R33, telemetry data must be reported to a usage reporting endpoint, such as NGINX Instance Manager. This data validates subscription entitlements and tracks usage metrics. This guide also covers how to use the [`ssl_verify`](#ssl_verify-and-usage-reporting-in-nginx-plus-r33) directive to secure telemetry reporting through certificate verification.

{{< important >}}Never expose your management server to the public internet. The settings in this guide reduce risk, but they can't replace keeping your server inaccessible to unauthorized users.{{< /important >}}

## NGINX Proxy SSL Termination

SSL termination is the process where SSL-encrypted traffic is decrypted at the proxy, in this case, NGINX Instance Manager. Once decrypted, the traffic can be sent to its destination unencrypted or re-encrypted, depending on the configuration.

To secure traffic between NGINX Plus instances and NGINX Instance Manager, you must configure an SSL certificate and key in the NGINX configuration. This setup applies to both NGINX Open Source and NGINX Plus. For more details, see the [NGINX SSL Termination guide](https://docs.nginx.com/nginx/admin-guide/security-controls/terminating-ssl-http/).

Starting with NGINX Plus R33, you must also enable `ssl_verify` to verify the SSL certificate used by NGINX Instance Manager when reporting telemetry data. See the section on [`ssl_verify` and usage reporting](#ssl_verify-and-usage-reporting-in-nginx-plus-r33) for more details.

The example below shows how to set up SSL termination for NGINX Instance Manager:

<details open>
    <summary>/etc/nginx/conf.d/nms-http.conf</summary>

```nginx
# Main external HTTPS server, needs port 443
server {
    listen 443 ssl;
    http2  on;
    root   /var/www/nms;

    server_name _;

    ssl_protocols       TLSv1.1 TLSv1.2;
    ssl_ciphers         HIGH:!aNULL:!MD5;
    ssl_session_cache   shared:SSL:10m;
    ssl_session_timeout 10m;

    ssl_certificate         /etc/nms/certs/manager-server.pem;
    ssl_certificate_key     /etc/nms/certs/manager-server.key;
    ssl_client_certificate  /etc/nms/certs/ca.pem;
```

## Mutual Client Certificate Authentication Setup (mTLS)

Mutual TLS (mTLS) is a security method that uses client certificates to verify both the server and the client during communication. This ensures that both NGINX Instance Manager and NGINX Plus instances are securely authenticated, protecting your network from unauthorized access. 

With mTLS, each NGINX instance has a unique client certificate that NGINX Instance Manager verifies before allowing communication. You can configure NGINX as a proxy to handle client certificates for this secure exchange.

Follow these steps to set up mTLS using a Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) system:

### Certificate Authority (CA) Setup

1. **Create a private Certificate Authority (CA)**: 
   - If you're testing, you can generate the CA on the same machine as NGINX Instance Manager. 
   - For production environments, follow your organization's security standards (these often require generating CAs on secure, offline machines).

2. **Set up root and intermediate CAs**:
   - The root CA issues certificates to an intermediate CA. The intermediate CA, in turn, issues certificates for clients and servers. This layered setup adds extra security by ensuring that the root CA is only used for top-level tasks.
   
3. **Issue Client and Server Certificates**:
   - The intermediate CA signs the certificate signing requests (CSRs) and issues certificates to NGINX clients and NGINX Instance Manager.

### Generate Certificates

To generate the necessary certificates, follow these steps. You can modify these instructions to suit your specific environment.

1. **Install OpenSSL** (if it isn't installed already).
2. **Create the certificate generation script**:
   - Use the following example script to generate the certificates for your CA, server, and client. Save the script as `make_certs.sh`.


    <details>
        <summary>make_certs.sh</summary>

    ```bash
    #!/bin/bash
    set -e

    make_ca() {
        echo "Creating Self-Signed Root CA certificate and key"
        openssl req \
            -new \
            -nodes \

        openssl verify -CAfile ca.pem server.crt
    }

    make_agent() {
        echo "Creating Agent certificate and key"
        openssl req \
            -new \
            -nodes \
            -keyout agent.key \
            -out agent.csr \
            -config agent.cnf
        openssl req -in agent.csr -noout -verify

3. **Place the configuration files**:
   - Put the following OpenSSL `.cnf` files in the same directory as the `make_certs.sh` script. These files are needed to configure the certificate authority and generate the appropriate certificates.

4. **Run the script**:
    - After saving the script, make it executable and run it to generate the certificates.

    ```bash
    sudo chmod +x ./make_certs.sh
    sudo ./make_certs.sh
    ```

5. **Copy the certificates to the NGINX instance**:
    - Once generated, copy the ca.pem, agent.crt, and agent.key files to the NGINX instance where the NGINX Agent certificates will be installed.

    ```bash
    sudo mkdir -p /etc/nms/certs
    sudo cp ca.pem /etc/nms/certs/
    sudo cp agent.crt /etc/nms/certs/
    sudo cp agent.key /etc/nms/certs/
    ```

6. **Modify the NGINX Agent configuration**:
	- Modify the `nginx-agent.conf` file to match the example below. The TLS options configure the NGINX Agent to use client certificate authentication with the NGINX proxy on NGINX Instance Manager. The `ca.pem` file is included as the certificate authority that the agent will use to verify NGINX Instance Manager’s server certificate.
	- If the CA is trusted by the operating system, you can omit the ca option.
	- Update the server host to match the NGINX Instance Manager address.

    {{< see-also >}}For additional information about TLS configurations for the NGINX Agent, refer to the [NGINX Agent TLS Settings](https://docs.nginx.com/nginx-agent/configuration/encrypt-communication/) topic. {{< /see-also >}}

    config_dirs: "/etc/nginx:/usr/local/etc/nginx"
    ```

    </details>

7. Copy `ca.pem`, `server.crt`, and `server.key` to NGINX Instance Manager.

    ```bash
    sudo cp ca.pem /etc/nms/certs/
    sudo cp server.crt /etc/nms/certs/
    sudo cp server.key /etc/nms/certs/
    ```

8. Add a new server to NGINX proxy for gRPC in the NGINX Instance Manager configuration with the newly generated certificates, then reload the service.

    - The `server_name` should match the `server.metrics` and `server.command` values in `nginx-agent.conf`.
    - You can remove `MetricsService` and `Commander` locations from the existing server.
    - The new server will enforce mTLS communication between NGINX Agent and NGINX Instance Manager, while the previous server can continue serving static content for the web interface and API without mTLS requirements.

    When `tls.skip_verify` is set to `false`, NGINX Agent verifies the server's certificate chain and hostname. Ensure the `server_name` in the configuration matches the Common Name (CN) or Subject Alternative Name (SAN) in the generated certificate.

    ```nginx
    # gRPC HTTPS server, needs port 443
    server {
        listen 443 ssl;
        http2  on;
        root   /var/www/nms;

        server_name nginx-instance-manager.example.com;

        ssl_protocols       TLSv1.1 TLSv1.2;
        ssl_ciphers         HIGH:!aNULL:!MD5;
        ssl_session_cache   shared:SSL:10m;
        ssl_session_timeout 10m;

        ssl_certificate         /etc/nms/certs/server.crt;
        ssl_certificate_key     /etc/nms/certs/server.key;
        ssl_client_certificate  /etc/nms/certs/ca.pem;
        ssl_verify_client on;

        # gRPC service for metric ingestion
        location /f5.nginx.agent.sdk.MetricsService {
            include /etc/nms/nginx/errors-grpc.loc_conf;
            grpc_socket_keepalive on;
            grpc_read_timeout 5m;
            grpc_send_timeout 5m;
            client_body_timeout 10m;
            grpc_pass grpc://ingestion-grpc-service;
        }

        # gRPC service for DPM
        location /f5.nginx.agent.sdk.Commander {
            include /etc/nms/nginx/errors-grpc.loc_conf;
            grpc_socket_keepalive on;
            grpc_read_timeout 5m;
            grpc_send_timeout 5m;
            client_body_timeout 10m;
            grpc_pass grpc://dpm-grpc-service;
        }
    ```

9. **Reload NGINX proxy configuration**:
   - Apply the new settings by reloading NGINX proxy configuration.

    ```bash
    sudo nginx -s reload
    ```

10. **Restart NGINX Agent**:
    - Start or restart NGINX Agent to apply the changes.

    ```bash
    sudo systemctl restart nginx-agent
    ```

## Configure SSL verification for usage reporting with self-signed certificates {#configure-ssl-verify}

{{<call-out "note" "Version requirements" "">}}
Usage reporting for NGINX Plus R33 or later in network-restricted environments requires **NGINX Instance Manager version 2.18 or later**.
{{</call-out>}}

Starting with NGINX Plus R33, NGINX Plus must report usage data to a reporting endpoint, such as NGINX Instance Manager. For more information, see [About subscription licenses]({{< relref "solutions/about-subscription-licenses.md" >}}).

The [`ssl_verify`](https://nginx.org/en/docs/ngx_mgmt_module.html#ssl_verify) directive in the [`mgmt`](https://nginx.org/en/docs/ngx_mgmt_module.html) block ensures that NGINX Plus connects only to trusted reporting endpoints by validating the server's SSL certificate. The `ssl_verify` directive is set to `on` by default.

### Why `ssl_verify` is important

When `ssl_verify` is enabled:

- NGINX Plus validates the SSL certificate presented by NGINX Instance Manager, ensuring it's from a trusted source.
- Secure telemetry transmission prevents man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks.

If the certificate is untrusted or invalid, telemetry reporting will fail. This failure can affect subscription validation and may prevent NGINX Plus from functioning properly.

### Trusting self-signed certificates

If NGINX Instance Manager uses a self-signed certificate, you must configure NGINX Plus to trust it explicitly. Use the [`ssl_trusted_certificate`](https://pp.nginx.com/yar/libxslt/en/docs/ngx_mgmt_module.html#ssl_trusted_certificate) directive to specify a PEM-formatted file that contains the trusted CA certificate:

```nginx
mgmt {
    usage_report endpoint=<NGINX-INSTANCE-MANAGER-FQDN>;
    ssl_verify on;
    ssl_trusted_certificate <CA-CERT-FILE-FROM-NGINX-INSTANCE-MANAGER>;
    ssl_name manager-server;
}
```

Using self-signed certificates requires careful configuration to avoid connection issues or potential vulnerabilities.

### Disabling `ssl_verify`

Disabling `ssl_verify` bypasses SSL certificate verification, which reduces security and is **not recommended** for production environments. However, you can disable it in specific cases, such as testing environments or troubleshooting connectivity issues:

```nginx
mgmt {
    ssl_verify off;
}
```

---

## Troubleshooting

If NGINX Agent and NGINX Instance Manager are having communication issues, follow these steps to troubleshoot:

1. **Check access and error logs**:
    - Make sure access and error logging are enabled to capture detailed information about errors and request processing.
    - By default, both logs are enabled in the `http` block of the main NGINX configuration file:

    ```nginx
    # nginx.conf
    http {
        ...
        access_log /var/log/nginx/access.log;
        error_log /var/log/nginx/error.log;
        ...
    }
    ```

2. **Check the logs for certificate issues**:
    - Review the logs for any errors related to certificates. Ensure the server is using the correct certificates and Certificate Authority (CA).
