## 2.19.0
February 6, 2025

### {{% icon-bug %}} Publishing the NAP policy fails with the error "The attack signatures with the given version was not found" {#45845}

{{<bootstrap-table "table table-striped table-bordered">}}

| Issue ID | Status |
|----------|--------|
| 45845    | Open   |

#### Description  

In NGINX Instance Manager v2.19.0, publishing an NGINX App Protect WAF policy from the UI fails if the latest NGINX App Protect WAF compiler v5.264.0 (for NGINX App Protect WAF v4.13.0 or v5.5.0) is manually installed without adding the NGINX repository certificate and key.

#### Workaround  

1. Download the NGINX repository certificate and key:
   - Log in to [MyF5](https://account.f5.com/myf5).  
   - Go to **My Products and Plans > Subscriptions**.  
   - Download the SSL certificate (*nginx-repo.crt*) and private key (*nginx-repo.key*) for your NGINX App Protect subscription.

2. Upload the certificate and key using the NGINX Instance Manager web interface:  
   - Go to **Settings > NGINX Repo Connect**.  
   - Select **Add Certificate**.  
   - Choose **Select PEM files** or **Manual entry**.  
   - If using manual entry, copy and paste your *certificate* and *key* details.

    For detailed steps, see [Upload NGINX App Protect WAF certificate and key](https://docs.nginx.com/nginx-instance-manager/nginx-app-protect/setup-waf-config-management/#upload-nginx-app-protect-waf-certificate-and-key).

3. Restart the `nms-integrations` service:
   
    ```shell
    sudo systemctl restart nms-integrations
    ```

### {{% icon-bug %}} NGINX Agent 2.36.0 fails to validate certain NGINX configurations in F5 NGINX Instance Manager 2.17.0 {#45153}

{{<bootstrap-table "table table-striped table-bordered">}}

| Issue ID | Status |

{{</bootstrap-table>}}
#### Description
In NGINX Instance Manager 2.17.0, an "invalid number of arguments" error appears in the web interface when using specific configuration parameters in NGINX Agent 2.36.0.

### {{% icon-bug %}} Web Analytics are not enabled after upgrading Instance Manager when keeping existing nms-http.conf {#45131}

{{<bootstrap-table "table table-striped table-bordered">}}

| Issue ID | Status |
|----------|--------|
| 45131    | Open   |

{{</bootstrap-table>}}
#### Description
When using NGINX Instance Manager, you configure OIDC by manually editing the /etc/nginx/conf.d/nms-http.conf and /etc/nms/nms.conf files.

During the upgrade to 2.17.0, the user is asked if they would like to keep their own nms-http.conf, or replace it with the new default. As Web Analytics are enabled via the /etc/nginx/conf.d/nms-http.conf file, if a user decides to keep their own config when prompted during upgrade, these will not get enabled.

#### Workaround

To keep the existing nms-http.conf file while maintaining the web analytics functionality, add the following to "/etc/nginx/conf.d/nms-http.conf" , inside the `/ui` location block:

```text
add_header Content-Security-Policy "default-src 'none'; block-all-mixed-content; frame-ancestors 'self'; object-src 'none'; manifest-src 'self'; script-src 'self' https://*.walkme.com 'unsafe-inline' 'unsafe-eval'; style-src 'self' https://*.walkme.com fonts.googleapis.com 'unsafe-inline'; img-src 'self' https://*.walkme.com s3.walkmeusercontent.com d3sbxpiag177w8.cloudfront.net data:; font-src 'self' https://*.walkme.com data: https://fonts.gstatic.com; connect-src 'self' https://*.walkme.com; frame-src 'self' https://*.walkme.com blob:; worker-src 'self' blob: https://*.walkme.com;";

### {{% icon-bug %}} Failure to retrieve instance configuration when NAP-enabled instance doesn't register properly {#45113}

{{<bootstrap-table "table table-striped table-bordered">}}

| Issue ID | Status |
|----------|--------|
| 45113    | Open   |

{{</bootstrap-table>}}
#### Description
If NGINX Agent is configured to monitor NGINX App Protect before App Protect is installed, NGINX Agent will send an empty App Protect metadata structure to NGINX Instance Manager. This causes Instance Manager to fail to register the NGINX instance properly.

#### Workaround

Edit the "/etc/nginx-agent/nginx-agent.conf" file and configure "precompiled_publication" as "false". Then restart the nginx-agent process running `sudo systemctl restart nginx-agent`.

### {{% icon-resolved %}} Editing template submissions now allows for using most recent template version {#44971}

{{<bootstrap-table "table table-striped table-bordered">}}

| Issue ID | Status                           |
|----------|----------------------------------|
| 44971    | Fixed in Instance Manager 2.17.0 |

{{</bootstrap-table>}}
#### Description
When editing a template submission, you can now choose between using a snapshot of the template from when it was first deployed or the latest version of the template. **Important:** Note that if you use the latest version, changes to the templates might make an augment template incompatible with a base template, causing the publication to the data plane to fail.

## 2.16.0
April 18, 2024

### {{% icon-resolved %}}  Editing template submissions uses the latest versions, may cause "malformed" errors {#44961}

{{<bootstrap-table "table table-striped table-bordered">}}

| Issue ID | Status                           |
|----------|----------------------------------|
| 44961    | Fixed in Instance Manager 2.17.0 |

{{</bootstrap-table>}}
#### Description
When editing a template submission, the system currently uses the latest template files instead of the specific snapshot of files associated with the submission. The latest template files might not be well-formed and can cause errors when generating a configuration. This can lead to an error message saying "malformed."

#### Workaround

Use caution when editing template submissions. If you encounter a "malformed" error, check the template for any changes that could have caused the issue.

To keep a template from being changed accidentally, set it to "Ready for Use" by doing the following:

1. Go to **Templates**.
2. Find the template you want to lock and click the **Actions** button (three dots).
3. Select **Edit**.
4. Select the **Ready for Use** option.

If you need to modify a template that you have already submitted, create a copy instead of editing the original:

1. On the **Templates** page, locate the template you want to edit.
2. Select the **Actions** button and choose **Edit Template Files**.
3. Select **Save As** to duplicate the template, then give it a name.

## 2.15.0
December 12, 2023

### {{% icon-resolved %}} Unable to use NMS Predefined Log Profiles for NAP 4.7 {#44759}

{{<bootstrap-table "table table-striped table-bordered">}}

| Issue ID | Status                           |
|----------|----------------------------------|
| 44759    | Fixed in Instance Manager 2.15.1 |

{{</bootstrap-table>}}
#### Description
The predefined NGINX Management Suite Log Profiles are incompatible with NGINX App Protect 4.7.

#### Workaround

To use the NGINX Management Suite predefined log profiles with NGINX App Protect 4.7 follow these steps:

1. Retrieve the content of the NMS predefined log profile through the NMS Log Profile APIs, accessible in the (Manage WAF Security Policies and Security Log Profiles) section.
1. Decode the content obtained in the previous step using base64 encoding.
1. Modify the "max_request_size" and "max_message_size" values within the decoded content to the following:

    **"max_request_size": "2k", "max_message_size": "32k"**

1. Create a custom log profile using the NMS Log Profile APIs, incorporating the base64 encoded content from the adjusted configuration.
1. Update your NGINX configuration to reference the new custom log profile in the NGINX App Protect log profile directive.

### {{% icon-bug %}} If you publish a configuration with an uncompiled policy, it will fail the first time {#44267}

{{<bootstrap-table "table table-striped table-bordered">}}

| Issue ID | Status |
|----------|--------|
| 44267    | Open   |

{{</bootstrap-table>}}
#### Description
In Instance Manager 2.13, a new configuration is published before the compile stage of a WAF policy is complete. This happens only when the policy is first referenced. This leads to a deployment failure, and the configuration rolls back. Typically, by the time you try to submit the configuration again, the policy has finished compiling, and the request goes through.

The initial failure message looks like this:

```text
Config push failed - err: failure from multiple instances. Affected placements: instance/70328a2c-699d-3a90-8548-b8fcec15dabd (instance-group: ig1) - err: failed building config payload: config: aux payload /etc/nms/NginxDefaultPolicy.tgz for instance:70328a2c-699d-3a90-8548-b8fcec15dabd not ready aux payload not ready, instance/2e637e08-64b3-36f9-8f47-b64517805e98 (instance-group: ig1) - err: failed building config payload: config: aux payload /etc/nms/NginxDefaultPolicy.tgz for instance:2e637e08-64b3-36f9-8f47-b64517805e98 not ready aux payload not ready
```

#### Workaround

Retry pushing the new configuration. The deployment should work the second time around.

### {{% icon-resolved %}} Validation errors in Resource Groups for certificates uploaded before 2.13 upgrade {#44254}

{{<bootstrap-table "table table-striped table-bordered">}}

| Issue ID | Status                           |
|----------|----------------------------------|
| 44254    | Fixed in Instance Manager 2.13.1 |

{{</bootstrap-table>}}
#### Description
If you upgrade to Instance Manager 2.13 and already have certificates in place, you may encounter validation errors in the web interface when you try to create or edit a Resource Group and access the Certs list. You will not be able to save the Resource Group if you encounter these errors.

This issue doesn't occur if you upload certificates _after_ upgrading to version 2.13, nor does it affect new 2.13 installations. Instance Groups and Systems are unaffected.

#### Workaround

To work around this issue, you have two options:

1. When creating or editing a Resource Group, don't use the Certs list. Instance Groups and Systems can still be used.
2. If you must use Resource Groups with Certs, delete any certificates that were uploaded before upgrading to 2.13, and then re-upload them.

{{<bootstrap-table "table table-striped table-bordered">}}

| Issue ID | Status |
|----------|--------|
| 43719    | Open   |

{{</bootstrap-table>}}
#### Description
If firewall rules prevent access to F5 servers, attempting to license NGINX Management Suite with a JWT license may result in the product being unable to terminate the license or upload another one, even if connectivity is restored.

#### Workaround

To fix this issue, follow the steps below for your environment type.

<br>

##### Virtual Machine or Bare Metal

1. Stop the integrations service:

   ``` bash
   sudo systemctl stop nms-integrations
   ```

2. Delete the contents of `/var/lib/nms/dqlite/license`

3. Start the integrations service:

   ```bash
   sudo systemctl start nms-integrations
   ```

4. Upload a valid S/MIME license.

   Alternatively, to use a JWT license, make sure to allow inbound and outbound access on port 443 to the following URLs:

   - https://product.apis.f5.com
   - https://product-s.apis.f5.com/ee

##### Kubernetes

1. Run the following command to stop the integrations service by scaling down:

   ```bash
   kubectl -n nms scale --replicas=0 deployment.apps/integrations
   ```
2. Access the Dqlite volume for the integrations service and delete the contents of `/var/lib/nms/dqlite/license`.

3. Run the following command to start the integrations service by scaling up:

   ```bash
   kubectl -n nms scale --replicas=1 deployment.apps/integrations
   ```

4. Upload a valid S/MIME license.

   Alternatively, to use a JWT license, make sure to allow inbound and outbound access on port 443 to the following URLs:

   - https://product.apis.f5.com

```

#### Workaround

If you encounter any of the errors mentioned above, you can attempt to rebuild and reload the NGINX Management Suite policy. To do so, follow these steps:

1. Copy the `nms.te` and `nms.fc` files to a directory on your target machine.

    - {{< fa "download" >}} {{< link "/nim/release-notes/41327/nms.te" "nms.te" >}}
    - {{< fa "download" >}} {{< link "/nim/release-notes/41327/nms.fc" "nms.fc" >}}

2. [Install the `policycoreutils-devel` package](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_enterprise_linux/9/html-single/using_selinux/index#selinux-architecture_getting-started-with-selinux).
3. Change to the directory where you copied the `nms.te` and `nms.fc` files.
4. Rebuild the `nms.pp` file:

    ```bash
    make -f /usr/share/selinux/devel//Makefile nms.pp
    ```

5. Remove any existing NGINX Management Suite policy:

    ```bash
    sudo semodule -r nms
    ```

6. Install the new policy:

    ```bash
    sudo semodule -n -i nms.pp
    ```

7. To finish installing the NGINX Management Suite policy, follow the remaining instructions from the package manager output and restart the NGINX Management Suite services:

### {{% icon-resolved %}} "Public Key Not Available" error when upgrading Instance Manager on a Debian-based system {#39431}

{{<bootstrap-table "table table-striped table-bordered">}}

| Issue ID | Status                          |
|----------|---------------------------------|
| 39431    | Fixed in Instance Manager 2.9.0 |

{{</bootstrap-table>}}
#### Description
When attempting to upgrade Instance Manager on a Debian-based system, the command `sudo apt-get update` may return the error “public key is not available,” preventing the NGINX Agent from being updated. To resolve this issue, you need to update the public key first.

#### Workaround

To manually update the public key, take the following steps:

1. Download a new key from the NGINX Management Suite host:

   - secure

       ```shell
       curl https://<NMS_FQDN>/packages-repository/nginx-signing.key | gpg --dearmor | sudo tee /usr/share/keyrings/nginx-signing.gpg >/dev/null
       ```

   - insecure:

       ```shell
       curl -k https://<NMS_FQDN>/packages-repository/nginx-signing.key | gpg --dearmor | sudo tee /usr/share/keyrings/nginx-signing.gpg >/dev/null
       ```

2. Update the `nginx-agent.list` file to reference the new key:

    ```shell
    printf "deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/nginx-signing.gpg] https://<NMS_FQDN>/packages-repository/deb/ubuntu `lsb_release -cs` agent\n" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/nginx-agent.list
    ```

#### Workaround

Download the `attack-signatures` and/or `threat-campaigns` packages for CentOS 7, RHEL 7, or Amazon Linux 2 from the NGINX repo directly to your Instance Manager host by following the instructions in the official NGINX App Protect documentation:

- [Attack Signatures Documentation](https://docs.nginx.com/nginx-app-protect/admin-guide/install/#centos--rhel-74--amazon-linux-2)
- [Threat Campaigns Documentation](https://docs.nginx.com/nginx-app-protect/admin-guide/install/#centos--rhel-74--amazon-linux-2-1)

After downloading the `attack-signatures` and/or `threat-campaigns` packages onto your Instance Manager host, give Instance Manager about 15 seconds to recognize these packages.

If the logging level is set to `debug`, you should see the following logs that confirm a successful installation:

### {{% icon-bug %}} Scan misidentifies some NGINX OSS instances as NGINX Plus {#35172}

{{<bootstrap-table "table table-striped table-bordered">}}

| Issue ID | Status |
|----------|--------|
| 35172    | Open   |

{{</bootstrap-table>}}
#### Description
When NGINX Plus is installed on a datapath instance, then removed and replaced with NGINX OSS, NGINX Instance Manager may incorrectly identify the instance as an NGINX Plus instance. This is due to multiple NGINX entries for the same datapath.

#### Workaround

Use NGINX Instance Manager's NGINX Instances API to remove the inactive NGINX instance. For instructions, refer to the API reference guide, which you can find at `https://<NGINX-INSTANCE-MANAGER-FQDN>/ui/docs`.

You may need to stop the NGINX Agent first. To stop the NGINX Agent, take the following steps:

```bash
sudo systemctl stop nginx-agent
```

{{<bootstrap-table "table table-striped table-bordered">}}

| Issue ID | Status |
|----------|--------|
| 34255    | Open   |

{{</bootstrap-table>}}
#### Description
NGINX Instance Manager reports metrics at a per-minute interval and includes dimensions for describing the metric data's characteristics.

An issue has been identified in which metric data is aggregated across all dimensions, not just for existing metrics data. When querying the Metrics API with aggregations like `SUM(metric-name)`, the aggregated data causes the API to over count the metric. This overcounting skews some of the metrics dashboards.

#### Workaround

When querying the Metrics API, you can exclude the data for an aggregated dimension by specifying the dimension name in the `filterBy` query parameter.

```none
filterBy=<dimension-name>!= ''
```

{{</bootstrap-table>}}
#### Description
When installing on CentOS 7, RHEL 7, and Amazon Linux 2, the package manager doesn't prevent installing NGINX Instance Manager with unsupported versions of NGINX or NGINX Plus. As a consequence, it is possible that `nms-instance-manager` is installed without an NGINX gateway. Resulting in a less than optimal experience.

#### Workaround
