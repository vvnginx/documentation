## Overview

The F5 NGINX Security Monitoring module tracks security violations on NGINX App Protect WAF instances. Its analytics dashboards use a Signature Database to provide details about Attack Signatures, including their name, accuracy, and risk.

If the Signature Database is outdated and doesnâ€™t match the version used in App Protect WAF, new signatures may appear without attributes like a name, risk, or accuracy.

Follow these steps to update the Security Monitoring module with the latest Attack Signature data, ensuring the dashboards display complete and accurate information.

## Before you begin

Ensure the following prerequisites are met:

- NGINX App Protect is configured, and the Security Monitoring dashboard is collecting security violations.

## Update the Signature Database

1. Open an SSH connection to the data plane host and log in.
1. Generate a Signature Report file using the [Attack Signature Report Tool]({{< relref "/nap-waf/v4/configuration-guide/configuration.md#attack-signature-report-tool" >}}). Save the file as `signature-report.json`:

    ```bash
    sudo /opt/app_protect/bin/get-signatures -o ./signature-report.json
    ```

1. Open an SSH connection to the management plane host and log in.
1. Copy the `signature-report.json` file to the NGINX Instance Manager control plane at `/usr/share/nms/sigdb/`:

    ```bash
    sudo scp /path/to/signature-report.json {user}@{host}:/usr/share/nms/sigdb/signature-report.json
    ```

1. Restart the NGINX Instance Manager services to apply the update:

    ```bash
    sudo systemctl restart nms-ingestion
    sudo systemctl restart nms-core
    ```
