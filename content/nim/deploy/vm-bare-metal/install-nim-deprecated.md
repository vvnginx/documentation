## Overview

Follow the steps in this guide to install or upgrade NGINX Instance Manager.

{{<call-out "caution" "Deprecated documentation notice" "fa fa-exclamation-triangle" >}}
This document outlines manual steps that have been replaced by a simplified script-based process. For most users, we recommend using the updated process documented [here]({{< relref "nim/deploy/vm-bare-metal/install.md" >}}).{{</call-out>}}

## Before You Begin

### Security Considerations

{{< include "installation/secure-installation.md" >}}

### Requirements {#requirements}

To install NGINX Instance Manager, you need the following:

- A trial or paid subscription for NGINX Instance Manager. [Sign up for NGINX Instance Manager at MyF5](https://account.f5.com/myf5).
- A Linux instance to host the NGINX Instance Manager platform and modules
- [NGINX Plus or NGINX OSS](#install-nginx) installed on the instance hosting NGINX Instance Manager

Allow external systems access by opening network firewalls. NGINX Instance Manager uses port `443` for both gRPC and API/web interfaces.

## Download Certificate and Key {#download-cert-key}

Follow these steps to download the certificate and private key for NGINX Instance Manager. You'll need these files when adding the official repository for installing NGINX Instance Manager. You can also use the certificate and key when installing NGINX Plus.

1. On the host where you're installing NGINX Instance Manager, create the `/etc/ssl/nginx/` directory:

   ``` bash
   sudo mkdir -p /etc/ssl/nginx
   ```

2. Download the NGINX Instance Manager `.crt` and `.key` files from [MyF5](https://account.f5.com/myf5) or follow the download link in your  trial activation email.

3. Move and rename the `.crt` and `.key` files:

   ```bash
   sudo mv <nginx-mgmt-suite-trial.crt> /etc/ssl/nginx/nginx-repo.crt
   sudo mv <nginx-mgmt-suite-trial.key> /etc/ssl/nginx/nginx-repo.key
   ```

   {{<note>}}The downloaded filenames may vary depending on your subscription type. Modify the commands above accordingly to match the actual filenames.{{</note>}}

---

## Install NGINX {#install-nginx}

Install NGINX Open Source or NGINX Plus on the host where you'll install NGINX Instance Manager. NGINX Instance Manager uses NGINX as a front-end proxy and for managing user access.

- [Installing NGINX and NGINX Plus](https://docs.nginx.com/nginx/admin-guide/installing-nginx/)

   {{<note>}}If you're installing NGINX Plus, you can use the `nginx-repo.key` and `nginx-repo.crt` that you added in the [previous section](#download-cert-key).{{</note>}}

## Install ClickHouse {#install-clickhouse}

{{<note>}}NGINX Instance Manager requires ClickHouse 22.3.15.33 or later.{{</note>}}
