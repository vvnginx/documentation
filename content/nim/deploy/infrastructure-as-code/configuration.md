## Installation steps

1. Install Ansible by following the [installation steps on GitHub](https://github.com/nginxinc/ansible-role-nginx-management-suite?tab=readme-ov-file#ansible).
2. Create the inventory file with the details of the host you want to install NGINX Instance Manager on. Make sure you have access to the host. [Example here](https://github.com/nginxinc/ansible-role-nginx-management-suite?tab=readme-ov-file#create-inventory-file).
3. Create the requirements file and install the required Ansible role by following [these steps](https://github.com/nginxinc/ansible-role-nginx-management-suite?tab=readme-ov-file#install-required-roles-and-collections).

4. Create and run the Ansible playbook. Create a file named `nms-playbook.yml` (or any other name) with contents similar to the following example:

    ```yaml
    - hosts: nms
      become: yes
      vars:
        nginx_license:
          certificate: ./nginx-repo.crt
          key: ./nginx-repo.key
        nms_setup: install
        nms_version: 2.16.0*
        nms_user_name: admin
        nms_user_passwd: default
        nms_modules:
          - name: sm
      collections:
        - nginxinc.nginx_core
      roles:
        - nginxinc.nginx_management_suite
    ```

5. Run the playbook:

    ```shell
    ansible-playbook -i <path-to-your-hostfile> nms-playbook.yml
    ```
