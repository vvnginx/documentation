## Overview

NGINX Instance Manager emphasizes role-based access control (RBAC) to manage user permissions. A predefined `admin` role is available for initial setup and administration, but you can create custom roles to match specific responsibilities, such as for API Owners or Infrastructure Admins. This lets organizations fine-tune access and permissions to suit their needs.

### Assign roles to users or user groups

Once youâ€™ve created roles, assign them to users or user groups to ensure that permissions align with responsibilities. This helps maintain clear and organized access control.
