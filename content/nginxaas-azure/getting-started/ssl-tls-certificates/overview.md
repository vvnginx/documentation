F5 NGINX as a Service for Azure (NGINXaaS) enables customers to secure traffic by adding SSL/TLS certificates to a deployment. NGINXaaS can fetch certificates directly from Azure Key Vault, rotate certificates, and provide observability on the status of your certificates.

This document provides details about using SSL/TLS certificates with your F5 NGINX as a Service for Azure deployment.

## Add SSL/TLS certificates

Add a certificate from an Azure Key Vault to your NGINXaaS deployment using your preferred client tool:

* [Add certificates using the Azure portal]({{< relref "/nginxaas-azure/getting-started/ssl-tls-certificates/ssl-tls-certificates-portal.md">}})
* [Add certificates using the Azure CLI]({{< relref "/nginxaas-azure/getting-started/ssl-tls-certificates/ssl-tls-certificates-azure-cli.md">}})
* [Add certificates using Terraform]({{< relref "/nginxaas-azure/getting-started/ssl-tls-certificates/ssl-tls-certificates-terraform.md">}})

### Add SSL/TLS certificates bundled with NGINXaaS configuration

You can also add your certificate as a file to your NGINX configuration filesystem; refer to [Upload an NGINX configuration]({{< relref "/nginxaas-azure/getting-started/nginx-configuration/overview.md">}}) to learn about the different options. Although this is a quick method for adding SSL/TLS certificates to your NGINXaaS deployment, we recommend adding certificates through Azure Key Vault (AKV) for enhanced security, certificate rotation, and monitoring.

Once a certificate has been added, update your NGINX configuration to reference your SSL/TLS certificate and key file paths.

```nginx
http {
   server {
      listen 443 ssl;
      ssl_certificate /etc/nginx/certs/mycert.cert;
      ssl_certificate_key /etc/nginx/certs/mycert.key;
      # ...
   }
}
```

## Certificate rotation

NGINXaaS for Azure regularly polls the AKV to check if the certificate has been updated. If an updated certificate is found, it is automatically rotated on the deployment within 4 hours. Any change to the NGINX configuration will trigger all SSL/TLS certificates to be rotated immediately.

For Azure client tools, such as the Azure CLI or Azure Resource Manager, the certificate is referenced from AKV using its Key Vault secret identifier. If the secret identifier specifies a version, NGINXaaS will not rotate the certificate. To enable certificate rotation, ensure the secret id does not contain a version, for example, `https://myvault.vault.azure.net/secrets/mysecret`. Certificates added using the Azure Portal will automatically be rotated.

{{<warning>}}If any of your SSL/TLS certificates or your NGINX configuration has issues, the certificates will not be rotated.{{</warning>}}

## Monitor certificates

To view the status of your SSL/TLS certificates, [enable monitoring]({{< relref "/nginxaas-azure/monitoring/enable-monitoring.md" >}}) for your NGINXaaS deployment and navigate to the **Metrics** tab in the Azure portal. View the `nginxaas.certificates` metric under the `nginxaas statistics` metric namespace. The `nginxaas.certificates` metric allows you to filter by certificate name and the status of the certificate. The status dimension reports the health of your certificates through the following values:

   {{<bootstrap-table "table table-striped table-bordered">}}

   | Status        | Description   |
   | ------------- | ------------- |
   | `active`      | The certificate was successfully fetched from AKV. |
   | `unauthorized`| Azure returned a 401/403 error when fetching the certificate from AKV, which usually indicates an issue with the deployment's [Managed Identity]({{< relref "/nginxaas-azure/getting-started/managed-identity-portal.md" >}}). |
   | `not found`   | Azure returned a 404 error when fetching the certificate from AKV. |
   | `incompatible`| An error occurred while fetching or processing the certificate from AKV. <br><br>The possible reasons include: <br> <br><ul><li>Error while downloading certificate and key</li><li>Missing content type in certificate</li><li>Missing content in certificate</li><li>Unrecognized content type, certificate not in PEM or PKCS12 format</li></ul> |

   {{</bootstrap-table>}}

   ```

1. Enable the certificate.
   ```bash
   az keyvault certificate set-attributes --enabled true --id $certificate_id
   ```
</details>

#### Error code: `NoCertificateContent`

**Description:** No certificate was found when parsing the file.

**Resolution:** Ensure the file is not empty and contains properly formatted PEM or PKCS12 certificate data.

#### Error code: `MissingContentType`

**Description:** The retrieved secret is missing the *contentType* field.

**Resolution:** When creating an [Azure certificate](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/key-vault/certificates/about-certificates) in key vault, the *contentType* field will be properly set to either *application/x-pem-file* or *application/x-pkcs12*. If a certificate is added as a generic [Azure secret](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/key-vault/secrets/about-secrets) the *contentType* field must be manually set to help with interpreting the secret data when it is retrieved. We recommend creating a certificate object, instead of a secret object containing certificate data, to ensure proprer formatting and *contentType*. 

#### Error code: `UnrecognizedContentType`

**Description:** The retrieved secret's content type, as interpreted from the *contentType* field, is of an unsupported type.

**Resolution:** When creating an [Azure certificate](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/key-vault/certificates/about-certificates) in key vault, the *contentType* field will be properly set to either *application/x-pem-file* or *application/x-pkcs12*. NGINXaaS does not support other content types added as generic [Azure secrets](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/key-vault/secrets/about-secrets). Ensure the provided certificate is either a PEM or PKCS12 [Azure certificate](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/key-vault/certificates/about-certificates).

#### Error code: `PKCS12ParseFailure`

**Description:** The PKCS12 certificate could not be parsed.

**Resolution:** Ensure the file is not empty and contains properly formatted PKCS12 certificate data.

#### Error code: `PEMParseFailure`

**Description:** The PEM certificate could not be parsed.

**Resolution:** Ensure the file is not empty and contains properly formatted PEM certificate data.
