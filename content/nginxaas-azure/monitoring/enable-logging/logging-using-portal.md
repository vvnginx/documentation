## Overview

F5 NGINX as a Service for Azure (NGINXaaS) supports integrating Azure Diagnostic Settings to collect NGINX error and access logs.

{{<caution>}}
Enabling logs using the **NGINX Logs** blade on your NGINXaaS deployment is now deprecated. This feature will be removed in an upcoming update. If you have issues accessing your NGINX logs using the deprecated method, please follow the steps in this guide to access your NGINX logs.
{{</caution>}}

## Configuring NGINX logs collection using diagnostic settings

### Prerequisites

- A valid NGINX configuration with log directives enabled. NGINX logs can be configured using [error_log](#setting-up-error-logs) and [access_log](#setting-up-access-logs) directives.

- A system-assigned managed identity.

{{<note>}}The system-assigned managed identity does not need any role assignments to enable the logging functionality described in this section. You will need to make sure that the managed identity has the appropriate role assignments to access other resources that it is attached to (for example, certificates stored in Azure Key Vault).
{{</note>}}

- User must be an owner or user access administrator for the NGINX deployment resource.

 ### Adding diagnostic settings

1. Go to your NGINXaaS for Azure deployment.

1. Select **Diagnostic Settings** in the left menu.

1. Select **Add diagnostic setting**.

1. Choose the **NGINX Logs** option and complete the details on the form, including the **Diagnostic setting name**.

{{<note>}}You will need to configure the system-assigned managed identity in order to see and select the **NGINX Logs** option.
{{</note>}}

1. Select preferred **Destination details**.

For more information about diagnostic settings destinations, please see the [Diagnostic Settings Destinations](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/essentials/diagnostic-settings#destinations) documentation.

{{<note>}}Due to limitations imposed by Azure, if the destination chosen is an Azure Storage account, the resource has to be in the same region as the NGINXaaS deployment resource.
{{</note>}}

{{<note>}}If you are a Terraform user, please refer to [examples](https://github.com/nginxinc/nginxaas-for-azure-snippets/tree/main/terraform/deployments/with-diagnostic-setting-logging) provided to setup diagnostic settings for your NGINXaaS deployment{{</note>}}

1. Select **Diagnostic Settings** in the left menu.
